186

you don't have a heart.

00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,477
That's what I like
about you.

189
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,731
So, I'm going
to let you live.

190
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,442
But there's
just one little thing

191
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,235
you have to do.

192
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,447
Get the Book of Peace
and bring it to me.

193
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,450
Right. Hmm. Now, see,
that's a problem for me

194
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,244
because I had my own plans
for it. Uh, ransom, get rich.

You know, "me" stuff.
(EXCLAIMS)

196
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:05,249
You're not thinking
big enough, Sinbad.

197
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,169
Steal the Book for ransom,
and you'll be rich enough

198
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,254
to lounge
on an island beach.

199
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:14,884
Steal the Book for me,
and you can buy the beach,

200
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,304
and the island
and the world.

201
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,513
Hmm.

202
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:22,350

you make me rich,

00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,062
So far,
I don't see a downside.

00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,397
If you keep your word.

206
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:30,358
Sinbad, when a goddess
gives her word,

207
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,235
she's bound for all eternity.

208
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,988
All right, you're on.

see it my way.

stolen the Book,

a major crush on me,

Now what do we do?
