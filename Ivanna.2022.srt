3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,917
I beg for your mercy! Please don't kill me!

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,208
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Be quiet!

5
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,458
Why did you come here?

6
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,042
You should leave this place,
or they will kill you.

7
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,583
Go help save the others.

8
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,042
Untie the others.

9
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,750
Be careful.

10
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,667
- Go!
- Quickly!

11
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,167
You should come with me now.

12
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,792
We'll run away from here.

13
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,125
They are outside.

14
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,667
They are outside.

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,833
Please listen to me. We should get out of here.

16
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,583
Please, listen just this once.

17
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,917
Save yourself.

18
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,125
Wait!

19
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:30,833
Detain everybody in this house.

20
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,417
Kill every Dutchman.

21
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,750
Take her!

22
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,958
Matsuya... Matsuya!

23
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:24,250
I beg you, let us go.

24
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,292
You promised to help us all.

25
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,833
We?

26
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,875
Who do you think you are?

27
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,292
I helped you.

28
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,625
I have given all the information you asked.

29
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:48,167
I have betrayed my own country.

30
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,750
I beg you...

31
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,542
Don't let us die in our own country.

32
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,958
Poor Netherland.

33
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:12,250
You are not a native in this country.

34
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,042
Tonight you will die in my country.

35
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,792
Quickly!

36
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,958
Come on!

37
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,458
The time is 14.03.

38
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,750
I'm bored.

39
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,458
So?

40
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,542
Let's play guessing games.

41
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,542
- What guessing games?
- Finger.

42
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,542
- Like yesterday?
- Yes.

43
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,750
Alright.

44
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,542
- Don't touch my hand.
- I can't see.

45
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,250
- Don't put your hand too far, Dika.
- No, Ambar.

46
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,208
You're cheating, touching is not allowed.

47
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,583
It's five.

48
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:11,000
Wrong.

49
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,708
You're cheating. One more time.

50
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,708
How many are these?

51
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,042
No, don't.

52
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,667
- It's two, right?
- You're right.

53
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,833
- But you're wrong.
- You're a cheat.

54
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,500
I don't want to play with you.

55
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,875
I'm not cheating, the answer is eleven.

56
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,333
How can it be eleven?

57
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,250
One and one. Eleven.

58
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,250
Ambar.

59
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,292
Ambar.

60
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,458
There is nobody behind us, right?

61
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,500
Don't look.

62
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,917
In the city, there are no rice fields like these.

63
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,333
Are we already at the incline?

64
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,500
Turn left.

65
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,708
- Here?
- Yes.

66
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,333
Is it still far, Dika?

67
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,042
Retirement Home

68
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,958
It's this way alright. But it's still far.

69
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,875
- Are you tired?
- No, not yet.

70
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,875
Careful, there's a car.

71
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,167
This way.

72
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,000
Careful, there's a car.

73
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,208
Come on. This way.

74
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:46,542
- Thank you.
- Take care.

75
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,667
Ambar! Dika!

76
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,875
Mom!

77
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,042
This way!

78
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,708
This way.

79
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,333
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

80
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,042
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

81
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,583
Ms. Wati, where are the other residents
of this retirement home?

82
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,625
During Eid holidays, many residents are away.

83
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,083
So only a few stay here.

84
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,792
Come in.

85
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,833
Wow, it's so big!

86
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,167
Agus, please take them to their room.

87
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,667
I will leave you for a moment.

88
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,875
Come on.

89
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,167
Dika, let's go.

90
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,583
This is your room.

91
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,000
This is nice!

92
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,583
- Come in.
- The room is big.

93
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,000
Where should I sleep?

94
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:05,083
Dika, don't mess up this room, okay?

95
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,083
Okay.

96
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,917
Let's go.

97
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,667
He looks so happy.

98
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,708
I hope you and Dika feel at home here.

99
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,042
One moment.

100
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,625
There's a piano!

101
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,250
I only know that song.

102
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,208
Don't be noisy, Dika.

103
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,208
What is this picture?

104
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:55,458
- Who is coming?
- The grandchildren of Wati's friend.

105
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,750
Her name is Ambar, right?

106
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,917
Dika.

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,958
This retirement home was opened in the 1970's.

108
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:13,250
Their parents have passed away.

109
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,708
So they are going to stay here.

110
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:19,583
Ambar, Dika, I will introduce you to the others.

111
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,417
This is Grandpa Farid. This is Grandma Ida.

112
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Come on in, Ambar.

113
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,167
Shake hands with all of them, Dika.

114
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,375
This is Grandma Ani.

115
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,000
- Hello, grandpa.
- Dika, sit next to grandma.

116
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,625
Sit here, dear.

117
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,708
- What?
- Hello, grandma.

118
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:53,042
Ambar, this is Grandma Ani.

119
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,750
Hello, Grandma Ani.

120
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,333
Sit here.

121
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,375
Here.

122
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,667
Are you blind?

123
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,208
Ani, don't say that.

124
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:15,958
She can still see.

125
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:20,292
It's okay. I can still see,
but not as clearly as others.

126
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,667
Very blurry.

127
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,750
Same like grandpa.

128
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,417
I used to have blurry vision too.

129
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,167
It's because you drank too much, grandpa.

130
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,167
Why, you!

131
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,167
Ambar, this is Rina.

132
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,375
She's the one who takes care of all of us here.

133
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,708
Hi, Rina.

134
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:43,667
Rina, please come here.

135
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,500
Have you two rested?

136
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,125
No, we haven't.

137
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,500
I want to say goodbye too.

138
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry that I can't celebrate Eid
with you all this year.

139
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,917
Is it alright, grandma?

140
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,167
- Agus.
- Yes, ma'am.

141
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,917
- I will leave them all for you to care.
- Okay.

142
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,375
- Take care, ma'am.
- Yes, okay.

143
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,750
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

144
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,625
- Why does Wati leave so soon?
- Grandma!

145
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,125
My grandson...

146
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,625
Grandma!

147
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,625
I'm sorry for coming late.

148
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,583
You should stay here for a week until Eid.

149
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,083
Yes, grandma.

150
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,125
Arthur, come greet the others.

151
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,083
Hello, everybody.

152
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,875
If there's a pretty girl like her,
even a month won't matter.

153
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:41,167
He just got here...

154
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,958
Hey!

155
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,000
What are you doing holding her hand?

156
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,417
No.

157
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,167
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

158
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,417
Dika.

159
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,667
He's Ida's favorite grandson.

160
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,583
But he rarely visits.

161
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,958
- Don't you fast?
- I forgot.

162
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:03,125
My grandson doesn't fast.

163
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,583
Catch it, grandpa.

164
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,042
- One more time, grandma.
- Okay.

165
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,708
Be careful, grandpa is old.

166
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:20,125
I'm sorry, Rina.

167
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,917
- Be careful, grandpa.
- Smile, grandma.

168
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,750
- Again, grandpa!
- Okay, Dika!

169
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,000
Open it up, then fill it up.

170
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,750
Slowly.

171
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,958
Yes, I can.

172
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,625
Slowly.

173
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,042
I can do it, right?

174
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,167
Can you really see it?

175
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,333
I can if it's this close.

176
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,083
I admire you.

177
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:51,167
Your parents have died.
And you have to take care of Dika.

178
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,583
I really don't expect this.

179
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,042
It's spilled.

180
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,417
It's okay. I'll clean it up.

181
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,292
- Really?
- Yes, please take it easy.

182
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,375
Ambar.

183
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,833
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,125
I couldn't make it to the funeral.

185
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,708
It's alright, I understand.

186
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:22,958
It's me who has to thank you
and Aunt Wati for having me here.

187
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:28,208
We are happy to have you here.

188
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,542
You make this place lively.

189
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,583
Right, Rina?

190
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,708
Agus!

191
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,958
Could you get my watch from the kitchen?

192
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,500
Yes, grandma.

193
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,208
Ambar, come.

194
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,708
Put this.

195
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,750
Look.

196
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:03,167
If this thing sounds,
that means someone is asking for help.

197
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,875
If you need help, just press the bell, this one.

198
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,208
Okay.

199
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,375
Rina?

200
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,667
What's the matter?

201
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,500
Why did you hold her hand like that?

202
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,083
We are friends since we were little.

203
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,333
Put it there. No, not there.

204
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,958
What's the matter with you?

205
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:27,875
During the fasting month,
the ghosts are locked up.

206
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,333
So we have to clean this up too.

207
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,750
Take a picture with the drinks too, grandpa.

208
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,083
Dika, pick that up!

209
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,417
- One, two...
- No, no, don't.

210
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,708
- It's dangerous.
- You're not fun.

211
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,542
Don't do that.

212
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,917
Just catch this.

213
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,667
Chase it!

214
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,958
Wait. We'll take a picture first.

215
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:04,333
One, two, three.

216
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:07,292
Catch this, grandpa!

217
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,458
- Grandma.
- Yes?

218
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,125
Here, grandpa.

219
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,333
Grandpa.

220
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,042
Let's go inside. It's going to rain.

221
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,750
Grandpa! The frisbee went inside.

222
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,958
Just leave it. We'll take it tomorrow.
It's going to rain.

223
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,667
Really?

224
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,000
Arthur, fetch Dika.

225
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,500
Dika!

226
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:48,000
What are you doing here?
It's going to rain. Let's go inside.

227
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:51,167
The frisbee is there.

228
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,333
It's raining now.

229
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,917
Just leave it there.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,083
Let's take it.

231
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,500
Okay, let's find the door.

232
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,042
Slowly, be careful.

233
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:20,208
Here's the door.

234
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,583
Dika!

235
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,833
Yes?

236
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,083
Oh my!

237
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
What is he doing there?

238
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,542
Dika!

239
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,042
I'm here!

240
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,375
Dika!

241
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,917
- Dika!
- Ambar!

242
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,750
The rain is so heavy, go inside!

243
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,208
Dika!

244
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,750
Dika!

245
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,875
Dika.

246
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,958
It's Arthur, right?

247
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,500
You're scaring me!

248
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,083
- Don't be so jumpy!
- He broke the door.

249
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,125
Ms. Wati always locks up this place.

250
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,958
This is the first time I'm here.

251
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:46,583
Ambar, does your boyfriend
has any plan to visit you?

252
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:51,583
Or, you don't have one?

253
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,792
Dika, you have found your toy, right?

254
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,333
Let's go home.

255
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,083
Dika.

256
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,167
What are you doing? Let's go home.

257
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,000
Dika.

258
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,042
Wow, so cool.

259
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,125
There are lots of things here.

260
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,333
There are many things.

261
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,625
Don't touch anything.

262
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,417
It looks dirty.

263
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,958
What is this?

264
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,750
Lots of old stuff.

265
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,417
Ambar!

266
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,042
- Arthur! Help!
- Ambar!

267
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,042
- Ambar!
- Ambar!

268
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,667
- Ambar!
- Ambar!

269
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,583
What is this? Shit.

270
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:02,333
Ambar...

271
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,125
Come on.

272
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,000
Ambar.

273
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,583
Slowly, Dika!

274
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,583
- Ambar, are you okay?
- Ambar, are you okay?

275
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,958
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm alright.

276
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,375
Are you sure? You fell from a high place.

277
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,167
No, I'm alright.

278
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,042
Thanks.

279
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,292
Shit. Looks like the wood has decayed.

280
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,667
Ouch!

281
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,000
What is this place?

282
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,375
I can't believe there is a place like this.

283
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,625
What is that?

284
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,167
- Come here.
- Be careful.

285
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,542
- See this.
- What is this?

286
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,542
It looks like a gramophone.

287
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,833
An early model gramophone.

288
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:10,042
You turn this and it will emit sounds.

289
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,292
Like an old compo?

290
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,167
Something like that.

291
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,167
There's a pot here.

292
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,292
I think all of the pots upstairs
were made here.

293
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,667
The tools are there.

294
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,833
What is this thing?

295
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:38,125
A chest!

296
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,042
- A chest?
- It's locked.

297
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,083
- Is there something in it?
- Yes, there must be something in it.

298
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:46,708
But how can we open it?

299
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,375
What is this?

300
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,333
Be careful.

301
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,000
What is that, Ambar?

302
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,292
What is that, Arthur?

303
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,208
This...

304
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,958
It's a statue, right?

305
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,208
Why is it headless?

306
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,708
Let's go back, Ambar.

307
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,333
Ambar? Dika?

308
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,458
- We're downstairs, Agus.
- Come down here.

309
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,125
Wow, what is this place?

310
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,458
Ambar, Dika, Arthur?

311
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:59,667
I just knew there is a basement here.

312
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,750
Agus, come here.

313
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,250
There is something interesting.

314
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:09,542
There is a chest. It surely contains gold.

315
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,542
Gold? Really?

316
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,458
- Let's take this upstairs.
- Good idea.

317
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,917
If it contains gold, we'll split them in two.

318
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,042
Split it in three, brother.

319
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,292
Okay.

320
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:27,875
- Ambar, do you want to bring the statue too?
- No, I don't.

321
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,375
- Is there a statue?
- Yes.

322
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,417
Why should we take that statue home?

323
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,417
Help me, it's heavy.

324
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,292
Ambar, let's go.

325
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,042
Ambar, Dika, let's go.

326
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,042
Ambar, let's go.

327
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,958
Ambar?

328
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:11,875
Let's go, Ambar.

329
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:30,292
Fasting till the last day feels so good.

330
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,750
I'm sorry. The cuts quite deep.

331
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,917
- How can we open it?
- Alright, let's try.

332
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,542
Maybe we need a screwdriver.

333
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,125
It's for the sores.

334
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,000
Thank you.

335
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,875
There, it's opened.

336
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,042
What is this?

337
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,417
What is this, bro?

338
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
Not bad.

339
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,833
Ambar, there are lots of things in here.

340
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,167
Many things.

341
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,250
What is that?

342
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,542
It is called a plate.

343
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:08,250
It was called a plate back then.
Now it's called a record.

344
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,667
It was a cassette in the old days.

345
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,083
Like the one there?

346
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:17,625
But why it's called a plate? Strange.

347
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:21,458
It is an old term.

348
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:25,458
They made a mess. I don't like it.

349
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,292
- Agus.
- Yeah?

350
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,750
- Come here.
- Who is it, grandpa?

351
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,333
She's pretty, right?

352
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,208
Whose things are those?

353
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:39,875
The owner must be a Dutchman who lived here.

354
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,917
Don't take someone's belonging.

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,333
Especially if it belongs to someone
from long time ago.

356
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,792
It might have something in it.

357
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:49,250
Ani, watch your mouth.

358
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,667
Do you still believe in those things?

359
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,917
- The Japanese and the Dutch are already gone.
- You don't understand!

360
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,708
What if there is something in it?

361
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,792
I understand, it's you who doesn't understand.

362
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:05,000
- Stop it, please.
- Calm down, grandma.

363
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:08,417
- She's always like that. Old fashioned.
- Calm down now.

364
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,167
Tomorrow is Eid.

365
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,292
She knows that and yet she got mad.

366
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,833
It's your fault. Why did you bring it here?

367
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,625
- It made them fight.
- Yes, my bad.

368
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,292
Do you know that song, Dika?

369
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Head, shoulder...

370
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,458
...knees and toes.

371
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,083
Right.

372
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:44,833
Let's all dance.

373
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:47,125
Come on, Ambar.

374
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,125
Let's dance!

375
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:55,000
Let's dance.

376
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,000
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

377
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,583
It's fun!

378
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,292
Be careful, grandma.

379
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:12,167
What happened?

380
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,000
Agus?

381
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,292
- Agus?
- Yes, grandpa.

382
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,917
- Ambar?
- Dika.

383
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,667
Check it outside.

384
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,375
Maybe the fuse tripped.

385
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,042
It's okay, Dika.

386
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,000
What is this?

387
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,625
Come on.

388
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,958
Are the neighbors' light also out?

389
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:40,375
I will check it out.

390
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:49,333
Looks like it's scheduled blackout as usual.

391
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,125
It's usual for a secluded place like ours.

392
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:55,292
How can this happen on Eid night?

393
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,792
How come?

394
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:07,208
Ambar, do you miss mom and dad?

395
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,708
I do. Very much.

396
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,792
How about you?

397
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,458
Me too.

398
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,417
I hope you like it here.

399
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,833
There is a scary well in the backyard.

400
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,542
Really?

401
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,542
Yes, a well.

402
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,208
You don't see anything strange?

403
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,083
No.

404
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,750
I didn't see anything.

405
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:52,000
I think that song was strange.

406
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,875
Spooky. I don't like to hear it.

407
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,750
Let's not talk about it.

408
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,917
Go to sleep. It's already late.

409
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,417
Go to sleep.

410
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,042
Grandpa?

411
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:34,583
Grandma?

412
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,500
You're scaring me!

413
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,833
I'm sorry, dear.

414
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,792
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,875
Is it cooked?

416
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,792
Almost.

417
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,542
I will wake up at three.

418
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,792
I don't have the energy to finish it now.

419
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,125
I'm very sleepy.

420
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,583
Is everybody asleep?

421
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,333
They should be.

422
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,083
But I haven't checked Ambar's room.

423
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,208
It's Ambar again and again.

424
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:38,667
Don't be mad.

425
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,625
She's like my own sister.

426
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,583
Since when you have a sister?

427
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,500
Did you meet her when she's already old?

428
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,000
An imaginary sister?

429
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:56,583
I like it when you're sulking.

430
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,875
Who is that?

431
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,708
Check it. Quick.

432
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,292
Who is it?

433
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,583
I don't know.

434
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,042
Let's go back to our room.

435
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,167
Honey.

436
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,333
Agus?

437
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,250
Rina?

438
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,458
Who are you?

439
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Who are you?

440
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,042
Let's get out of here.

441
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:01,542
I will pick you up.

442
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,542
Help!

443
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,708
Help.

444
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,625
What's the matter?

445
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,292
Ambar?

446
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,250
Ambar?

447
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,833
The light was on.

448
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,833
What are you seeing?

449
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:43,708
Nothing. Come on.

450
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,125
What did you see there?

451
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,667
No, I didn't see anything.

452
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,125
Let's go to sleep.

453
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,792
Rina?

454
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,375
Ida?

455
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:56,833
Who played the music? It's noisy.

456
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:08,625
Rina?

457
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,167
Agus?

458
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,583
Agus?

459
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:11,083
Rina?

460
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:16,458
Agus?

461
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:07,125
Agus always puts them in the middle of the way.

462
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,667
Agus?

463
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:43,750
Yes, dear?

464
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,042
Why didn't you wake me up?

465
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,833
Why are you mad so early in the morning?

466
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:57,333
I didn't heat the food last night.
It's become stale. A bad soup is bad omen.

467
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:01,875
Calm down. There is another meal.

468
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:05,667
And what we will eat the rice cake with?
With chili?

469
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,042
- Just clean it up and help me cook.
- Okay, okay.

470
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,792
What shall I cook?

471
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:13,833
- Where is the other pan?
- It's in the usual place, Rina.

472
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,542
Ambar, Dika. Please sit down.

473
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:20,917
I think it wasn't this messy yesterday.

474
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:25,458
We didn't go for the Eid prayer.

475
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:32,083
I woke up at dawn, but then I slept again.

476
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,708
We didn't go for the Eid prayer.

477
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:37,625
Did you wake up again?

478
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,000
Did you wake up?

479
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:47,083
I heard the sound of intercom last night.

480
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:52,667
Did anybody call last night?

481
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:58,167
The intercom sounded?

482
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,958
The light was out.

483
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,208
But the intercom sounded.

484
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,125
But strangely, no one called.

485
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,625
And it was from the kitchen.

486
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,083
- Agus?
- Yes, grandpa.

487
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,208
What is it?

488
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,292
What is this statue?

489
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,042
Why is it here?

490
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:32,083
So strange.

491
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:39,375
How can it be here? Who brought it?

492
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:46,083
You did this, right?

493
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,167
Maybe...

494
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,542
Don't tell me...

495
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:52,792
This...

496
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:56,125
What is this statue?

497
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:01,708
- Not me.
- You brought this.

498
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:05,500
Don't act surprised.
Yesterday you said not to bring it here.

499
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,375
- But you brought it anyway.
- I was in the kitchen.

500
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:11,208
Look, the door is open. You must have done it.

501
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:13,958
No, it's not me.

502
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:18,292
Arthur, don't be kidding.

503
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,125
It must be you who brought that here.

504
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:24,625
Impossible. It was raining last night.

505
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,417
I wouldn't want to get wet just to bring it here.

506
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,083
There is no way that statue can walk by itself.

507
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,375
Grandpa!

508
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:36,333
Don't fight now.

509
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:40,333
Remember, it's still Eid today.

510
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:44,542
Hear that? It is still Eid today.
Why don't you go back to the pavillion?

511
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:49,083
Agus, take it back, will you?

512
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,583
Ambar.

513
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:58,792
Apparently, this is a diary of a Dutch woman.

514
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,458
She used to live here.

515
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:07,375
I just read a part of it.

516
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:23,292
The Dutch woman lived in this house
since she was a little.

517
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:27,417
Her parents loved Indonesia and its people.

518
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:33,875
They even gave an Indonesian name
to her youngest brother.

519
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,958
Tragedy came to the family.

520
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:46,458
Her brother was murdered.

521
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,917
Her mother got sick, and then she died.

522
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,167
Her father committed suicide.

523
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:57,167
Poor woman.

524
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,250
Have you seen strange things in this house?

525
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,958
What do you mean?

526
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:10,958
Ambar has never told anyone about this.

527
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,833
Since I had eye surgery...

528
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,667
...my eyes are sensitive to the things...

529
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,667
...that nobody can see.

530
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,042
So you can sense supernatural things?

531
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,250
Last night I saw something.

532
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,167
But strangely...

533
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:38,375
...I could see clearly this time.

534
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,083
Everything was clear.

535
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,625
And even stranger...

536
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:49,500
...I heard that Dutch song on the intercom.

537
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:56,833
Then I saw the Dutch woman.

538
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:29,292
Once more, grandma. Smile, please.

539
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,375
- Smile!
- Yes, that's it.

540
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,167
Keep it up, grandma. Beautiful!

541
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,500
One, two, three.

542
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,208
Very beautiful, grandma.

543
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:42,000
- Ambar, Dika, let's take a picture.
- Sorry, I'm late.

544
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,833
It's okay.

545
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,333
Please sit.

546
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,083
Come here, Dika.

547
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,167
It's ketupat!

548
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,792
Sit with grandma.

549
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:56,875
Rina, Agus, let's take a picture.

550
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,792
Come on, gather up!

551
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:03,500
Let's take a picture.

552
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,750
Smile!

553
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:08,083
One, two, three.

554
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:10,458
Beautiful.

555
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:12,000
One more time.

556
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,625
Where is Grandma Ani?

557
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,667
You're right.

558
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,667
- Haven't you checked?
- I was busy in the kitchen.

559
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,667
I thought you have checked.

560
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,125
Let's take another picture.

561
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,583
Look here, all of you.

562
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:32,625
Look here and smile as usual.

563
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,292
One, two, three.

564
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,917
Grandma.

565
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,250
Grandma.

566
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,125
Grandma?

567
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,875
Is Grandma Ani here?

568
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:27,625
She's not in her room.

569
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,292
I'm so scared.

570
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,833
She's not in the backyard either.

571
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,958
We have to look for her.

572
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:37,958
Arthur, help us find her.

573
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:39,625
Let's go.

574
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,333
- Grandma Ani!
- Ani!

575
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:44,917
Grandma!

576
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,542
You go that way, grandma.

577
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:53,250
- Ani!
- Grandma Ani!

578
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:55,625
Grandma!

579
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,542
- She's not in the backyard?
- Nope.

580
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:59,167
Check in there.

581
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,917
Grandma!

582
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,958
Grandma Ani!

583
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:08,708
- Grandma?
- Grandma Ani!

584
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,375
Grandma Ani?

585
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,833
Grandma?

586
00:52:37,292 --> 00:52:38,750
Grandma Ani?

587
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,083
Grandma?

588
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:50,500
Grandma Ani?

589
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:56,833
Grandma?

590
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,208
Grandma?

591
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:11,375
Grandma Ani?

592
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,167
Grandma Ani?

593
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,333
Grandma...

594
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,542
Who is that? Let's go.

595
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,000
- I think it's Ambar.
- Dika, come on!

596
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,667
Hurry up!

597
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,917
Grandma Ani?

598
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,583
Grandma Ani!

599
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,958
Don't you feel strange?

600
00:54:53,042 --> 00:54:55,875
How come the statue is there?

601
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,083
I don't know either.

602
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,333
But it's strange indeed.

603
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,875
Come, I'm right here.

604
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,625
Just be calm.

605
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:39,375
Promise me, Ambar.

606
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,833
That we will leave this place...

607
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,208
...if you see strange things.

608
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:55,458
What's important is that we always stay together.

609
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:58,542
We will be fine.

610
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:33,667
Agus, open the door. Grandma wants to go.

611
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:38,000
Grandma, just stay inside. It's raining outside.

612
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,375
Agus, open it up!

613
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:47,917
Open it!

614
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:51,917
Arthur, be patient please.

615
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,333
If you and the others want to stay,
that's your choice. That's okay.

616
00:56:56,417 --> 00:57:00,000
As for me, I want to make sure
my grandma and myself are safe.

617
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,333
So open the door now!

618
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,083
Open the door! Where is the key?

619
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:05,250
Stop it!

620
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:08,167
- Now is not the time to fight.
- Be patient!

621
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:14,333
I don't feel safe here, grandpa.

622
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:17,625
There is a dead elderly person with no head.

623
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,167
Where will you go? What will you ride?

624
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,167
We all have to leave this place!

625
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,583
This place is dangerous.

626
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:27,000
You cannot bring your grandma like this.

627
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,625
Agus, Grandma Ani was murdered.

628
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:31,958
She's headless.

629
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,542
Do you want to leave her body just like that?

630
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,250
This is not only about you.

631
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,000
This is about my family.

632
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:47,167
Everybody here, including you, is my family.

633
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,708
My responsibility.

634
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,750
We will wait here.

635
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,583
I have called the police.

636
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:02,875
Agus.

637
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,417
Agus.

638
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:09,833
I don't feel safe here.

639
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:11,208
Please open the door.

640
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:16,125
Grandma, the police will come shortly.

641
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:19,208
You must not walk so far.

642
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:21,375
Please, grandma.

643
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:24,000
Please.

644
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,792
I'm begging you to stay here.

645
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,750
Come on.

646
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:34,125
Listen.

647
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:39,917
If we stay together in this place,
we will be safe.

648
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,417
Believe it!

649
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,333
And what if the killer is still here?

650
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:48,708
Do you want us to have the same fate as her?

651
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:54,958
Arthur!

652
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:58,250
Let him be.

653
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,292
What took the police so long to come?

654
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,292
Maybe it's because of the Eid holiday.
Not everybody is working.

655
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,875
I want to go home.

656
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:12,250
Yes, grandma. It won't be long.

657
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,500
That statue. Did somebody move it?

658
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,667
Are you kidding?

659
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:57,208
Look.

660
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:04,917
I know you're the one
who brought the statue here, right?

661
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,458
Right?

662
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:16,125
Listen.

663
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:19,542
Just think of it.

664
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,917
Why should I bring that thing?

665
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,583
And I wasn't kidding,
that statue wasn't there just now.

666
01:00:24,667 --> 01:00:26,042
Enough!

667
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:29,542
I believe Arthur.

668
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,792
Last night the Dutch song
suddenly played on the intercom.

669
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,792
I saw that Dutch woman in the kitchen.

670
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,792
You saw it?

671
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:52,750
What do you mean by that?

672
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:58,750
I can see things you can't.

673
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,667
Just stop it, Ambar.

674
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,458
Today is already chaotic.

675
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:08,667
I have never seen anything strange while I'm here.

676
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,250
So please don't make the situation worse.

677
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:42,333
Good evening. I'm from Cimaju Police station.

678
01:01:42,417 --> 01:01:44,000
Did somebody call?

679
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,208
Hi, everybody. I'm Yudi.

680
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:52,292
My condolences.

681
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,917
I'm sorry to come late. It is the rain.

682
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,917
The weather makes the trip here difficult.

683
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:03,958
It is very unfortunate
to have someone die on Eid itself.

684
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:06,958
It's alright, Mr. Yudi.

685
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:10,875
I'm sorry, but did you come alone?

686
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,458
Yes.

687
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:15,625
Have you called for the ambulance?

688
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:17,833
The deceased grandma...

689
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:22,833
...was she sick or she had a heart attack?

690
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,583
That?

691
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,542
Are you okay?

692
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:15,917
HQ, come in.

693
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:26,500
HQ? I need back up.

694
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:31,083
The Dutch woman that Ambar meant...

695
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:35,375
...was the writer of this diary.

696
01:03:38,917 --> 01:03:41,375
Who is this?

697
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,667
Let me see.

698
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:50,333
It is written here that he was
the leader of the Japanese army.

699
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:53,125
His name was Matsuya.

700
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,542
Come in, HQ! I need back up.

701
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,667
I need back up, there is a homicide.

702
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,125
Damn!

703
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,000
Hey!

704
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,708
Who's there?

705
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:49,042
It looks like Matsuya was close to the Dutch woman.

706
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:53,500
She said that she used to be a Jugun ianfu.

707
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:55,292
Poor woman.

708
01:04:56,792 --> 01:05:00,125
- Jugun ianfu?
- Yes.

709
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:02,458
Japanese comfort woman.

710
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,500
- Where is the phone?
- Right there, sir.

711
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:29,917
Maybe the killer is still in the vicinity.

712
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:37,792
- It's disconnected.
- It was on.

713
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,500
Ambar.

714
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,167
Let's just stay here.

715
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,917
But it's not safe here.

716
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,750
Just listen to them.

717
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,792
We have to leave this place as soon as possible.

718
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:53,500
The statue.

719
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:12,042
Looks like another scheduled blackout.

720
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:13,833
Where is the electrical panel?

721
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:16,958
- It's behind the building.
- We will go there.

722
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:19,875
Maybe somebody shuts the light on purpose.

723
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,208
All of you stay here...

724
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:25,917
...and lock every door.

725
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,750
Come with me.

726
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,833
- Help me for a moment.
- Okay.

727
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,042
- Help me for a moment.
- I heard you.

728
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,042
- Here.
- Thank you.

729
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:50,458
That's what I'm telling you all.
No one believes me.

730
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:52,667
I should not be here.

731
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,708
Everybody, take a rest.

732
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,583
What's the matter, Dika?

733
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:04,625
The statue, it moved.

734
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,250
It stood up.

735
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,875
Why is the gramophone on?

736
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,792
Ambar?

737
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,042
Come, quickly!

738
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,750
Don't make a sound.

739
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:27,125
We have to go out now.

740
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,625
Ambar?

741
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:36,708
How come it's on?

742
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,792
Let's go now.

743
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,875
- Let's go to the kitchen.
- We have to go now.

744
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:46,667
We don't have time.

745
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,000
- Let's come here.
- They will come!

746
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,792
Ambar.

747
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:04,792
Please help!

748
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,208
What are you doing?

749
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:09,208
What are you doing?

750
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:14,208
Let her go!

751
01:09:15,917 --> 01:09:17,583
Grandpa, what's going on?

752
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:20,750
Ambar, did you see something?

753
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:24,792
That woman is hit and dragged away.

754
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:44,833
Let go!

755
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:56,417
Please go now!

756
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,208
What is that sound?

757
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:06,958
Maybe it's the sound of the vision
that Ambar saw here.

758
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,792
Go away, all of you!

759
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,167
No matter what, she is Dutch.

760
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,875
They made us suffer.

761
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:34,792
Damn you all!

762
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,000
That woman was tortured...

763
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,333
...by our people.

764
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:54,250
By the native people.

765
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,458
Don't move!

766
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:14,667
Don't move!

767
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:17,792
Show her...

768
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:22,417
...that we are more powerful than their people.

769
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,875
They have made you suffer for hundreds of years.

770
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:31,000
What's that, Ambar?

771
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:35,583
There is a Japanese soldier coming towards them.

772
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:43,167
I promised...

773
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,542
...to help you all.

774
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,083
But...

775
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:57,458
...you are not a part of them.

776
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,792
Have a taste of this betrayal!

777
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:14,583
They want you dead.

778
01:12:23,792 --> 01:12:27,625
Your love toward them...

779
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:32,000
...means nothing anymore.

780
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,750
Each drop of my blood...

781
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:06,417
...will make your life miserable.

782
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,458
I'm afraid.

783
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:51,375
Here, stay with me.

784
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:56,125
It's off!

785
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,083
I will kill you all!

786
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:15,208
Bastards!

787
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:17,500
Whose voice is that?

788
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,625
Ambar?

789
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,000
Ambar?

790
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:44,792
Where are you going?

791
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,792
Ambar?

792
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:51,167
Ambar.

793
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,833
Where are you going?

794
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:26,833
Use the umbrella.

795
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,875
Ambar!

796
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:33,375
Wait up!

797
01:15:34,667 --> 01:15:37,708
Be careful!

798
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:38,958
Ambar.

799
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:40,792
What are you doing here?

800
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,667
He went inside.

801
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:47,458
That statue. I believe Ambar.

802
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,667
What is this?

803
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,292
Where are you all going?

804
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,375
Bring grandma in, Dika.

805
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:55,667
What's going on?

806
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,875
It is not safe inside, Agus.
We saw strange things.

807
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:02,833
He went here.

808
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:04,375
Who is he?

809
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,125
What is this room?

810
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:16,042
What's the matter with Ambar?

811
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:20,500
Ambar can see things that happened in the past.

812
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,958
What is that?

813
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:40,667
It is the shadow that we saw upstairs.

814
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:43,583
Maybe this is connected
with the death of grandma Ani.

815
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,208
What do you mean?

816
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,792
Why is it on?

817
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,250
How come is it on?

818
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,875
What's he doing?

819
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,083
Do you still remember...

820
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:57,875
...the song we used to sing in the front yard?

821
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:03,667
I will always savor your mom's dishes.

822
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:11,958
I will always remember
how your mom and dad loved us.

823
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,167
But...

824
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:20,208
...your love for this country...

825
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:24,292
...made you suffer instead.

826
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,458
What is that, Ambar?

827
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,750
He made her into a statue.

828
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:45,042
And her body is inside the statue.

829
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,917
So is the statue upstairs?

830
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:07,250
I will always remember you.

831
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,458
Forgive me.

832
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:16,625
Every drop of your blood
will make their life uneasy.

833
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:45,292
- Where are you going?
- Ambar, where are you going?

834
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,917
- Wait up!
- Ambar.

835
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,208
The man is going upstairs.

836
01:19:50,292 --> 01:19:52,000
What do you see, Ambar?

837
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:53,625
What's the matter?

838
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,708
What's the matter, Ambar?

839
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,750
Damn you all!

840
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,292
What's the matter?

841
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,125
What's the matter?

842
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:25,167
That man was hit and dragged.

843
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,125
Ambar, why did the chair fall?

844
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:54,083
It wasn't like this, right?

845
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,667
Be careful, sir.

846
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,417
So strange.

847
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,292
What's that?

848
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:12,958
What shall we do?

849
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:18,417
Let's go upstairs!

850
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,167
What shall we do?

851
01:21:42,042 --> 01:21:44,083
Go, all of you!

852
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:48,333
Let's go upstairs!

853
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:55,125
Hurry up, go upstairs!

854
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,292
Agus!

855
01:21:59,542 --> 01:22:01,583
Rina!

856
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:27,833
- Quickly!
- Agus!

857
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:37,375
Hurry up!

858
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:47,333
We have to get away from here!

859
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:49,667
Everybody, get into my car!

860
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,792
Quickly, everybody!

861
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:54,458
Rina, we have to go!

862
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:57,958
- Rina, let's go!
- I won't leave Agus!

863
01:22:58,042 --> 01:23:00,042
Help grandma!

864
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:03,125
Ambar, quickly!

865
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:09,083
Run, quickly!

866
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:12,625
Quick!

867
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:21,708
It won't start!

868
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:23,750
Please hurry up!

869
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:32,250
What's going on?

870
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:37,000
What's going on? It turns on by itself.

871
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,042
Quick, start the car!

872
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,583
Every drop of my blood...

873
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:56,500
- ...will make your life miserable.
- Turn it off!

874
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:59,833
Return my head!

875
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:12,708
That! She's behind us!

876
01:24:12,792 --> 01:24:15,042
She's coming towards us!

877
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:19,250
Return my head!

878
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:22,083
She's gone!

879
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:38,833
Lock the door!

880
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:42,250
Lock it!

881
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:49,167
Grandma!

882
01:24:50,167 --> 01:24:52,042
Ida!

883
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:58,875
I can't open it!

884
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:02,375
Help!

885
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:05,417
Grandma!

886
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,167
Arthur!

887
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:11,542
Grandma...

888
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,917
- Arthur!
- Grandma!

889
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,417
Grandma!

890
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:32,792
Arthur!

891
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:39,625
Arthur!

892
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:05,958
Arthur!

893
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,000
Arthur...

894
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,625
We have to walk.

895
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:29,375
If we get out, we will die!

896
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:35,250
What must we do?

897
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:39,042
She wants our heads.

898
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:49,750
Maybe we should destroy the statue?

899
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,500
We should go back inside.

900
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:05,375
Quickly!

901
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,292
Let's destroy it!

902
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:18,833
Now!

903
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,333
What is it, Ambar?

904
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,000
That Japanese soldier...

905
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,083
...dumped her head in the well.

906
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:34,125
The well in the backyard.

907
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,292
Ambar!

908
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,708
Dika!

909
01:27:37,792 --> 01:27:40,125
We'll take it there! We'll destroy it there!

910
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:53,375
Be careful.

911
01:27:57,458 --> 01:28:00,875
He dumped her head here.

912
01:28:01,917 --> 01:28:03,875
We will destroy it here.

913
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:06,000
Take that axe.

914
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:12,708
Get those alcohol bottles!

915
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:15,917
- Alcohol?
- There's no time for discussion, quick!

916
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:22,250
Quick!

917
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:34,333
What is that?

918
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:36,208
Ambar is right.

919
01:28:36,292 --> 01:28:38,125
Her body is in this statue.

920
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:44,375
We'll dump it inside the well.
We'll burn it there.

921
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:47,500
Get those bottles!

922
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,250
The jerrycan.

923
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:07,417
Quick.

924
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,458
Take that!

925
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:15,250
Come on!

926
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,333
Now we burn it!

927
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:19,000
Where's the match?

928
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:20,375
Burn it!

929
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,375
Damn! It's in the car!

930
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,167
Quickly, sir!

931
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,875
Get the match in the kitchen!

932
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,500
Dika! Ambar!

933
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:30,875
Dika, Ambar! Wait there!

934
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,250
Dika!

935
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:49,417
Dika! Rina!

936
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,625
Ambar!

937
01:30:51,708 --> 01:30:54,125
Ambar and Dika fell.

938
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,625
Dika!

939
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:10,917
All of you will die!

940
01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:17,083
- They fell!
- How come?

941
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:18,625
Dika, Ambar!

942
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:19,917
Dika!

943
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,083
Ambar!

944
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:24,375
Dika.

945
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:26,542
Where are you?

946
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:30,958
Dika...

947
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,458
Where are you?

948
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:41,958
Dika!

949
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,667
Where are you?

950
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,667
Ambar!

951
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,417
Dika!

952
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,708
- Where's the match?
- Here.

953
01:32:09,792 --> 01:32:11,417
Just throw the match!

954
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,000
Throw the match!

955
01:32:14,083 --> 01:32:16,167
Throw the match, Rina!

956
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:18,625
Dika! Ambar!

957
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:21,042
Ambar! Dika!

958
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,500
Ambar!

959
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:55,250
Ambar...

960
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:03,292
Return my head!

961
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,083
Dika...

962
01:33:26,292 --> 01:33:28,167
Ambar!

963
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,125
Ambar!

964
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:03,958
Ambar!

965
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:21,667
Ambar?

966
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,750
Ambar.

967
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,708
Are you alright?

968
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:34,417
Ambar!

969
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:38,458
Hey, are you alright?

970
01:34:38,542 --> 01:34:41,750
Help will come, calm down.

971
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:51,208
One week later

972
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:56,125
Did all the residents move out, ma'am?

973
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:57,208
Yes.

974
01:35:57,292 --> 01:36:01,000
But since that incident
there are only a few who live here.

975
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:05,417
That incident was very shocking.
The news was everywhere.

976
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,083
Luckily there are survivors.

977
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:10,667
We are moving to another location.

978
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:25,000
Anything else, sir?

979
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:28,708
Grandpa.

980
01:36:28,792 --> 01:36:30,708
- This too.
- Just this, sir?

981
01:36:30,792 --> 01:36:32,875
Yes, I will take this to the car.

982
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,583
This woman, who is she with?

983
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,167
Let me see.

984
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:47,750
Looks like it's her sister.

985
01:36:54,167 --> 01:36:58,250
Dimas, Elizabeth, Ivanna.

986
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:13,208
- Let's go, Ambar.
- Yes.

987
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,917
Let's go, grandpa.
