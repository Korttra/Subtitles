3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,183
Two thousand five hundred years ago,

4
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,311
a monster started opening the door

5
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:06,232
that bridges the human realm
to hell in order to make humans suffer.

6
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,488
But the Buddha appeared before the monster

7
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,282
and pulled out

8
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,785
the Red Eye

9
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,244
and the Black Eye,

10
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,164
which were the source of his power.

11
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,711
However, both eyes
escaped the Buddha's hands

12
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:31,257
and started to run away from the Buddha.

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,846
The Black Eye was caught
by the Buddha soon enough

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,517
and was locked inside a sarira casket.

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,525
But the Red Eye,
on the other hand, managed to get away

16
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,861
by hiding inside people's bodies
and running away for seven nights.

17
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,909
Then, on the eighth night,
the Red Eye stopped and turned around,

18
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,745
thinking it had come far enough.

19
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:07,335
But upon realizing that the path
it had been on was actually a bridge

20
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,463
consisting of seven stepping stones
over a narrow, shallow stream,

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,093
the Red Eye learned that
it could never escape from the Buddha.

22
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,303
So it faked surrender

23
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,014
and voluntarily got into a sarira casket.

24
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,730
After sealing them
inside the caskets and locking them up

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,609
in the vast deserts of the west
and the steep cliffs of the east,

26
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,488
the Buddha said to his nameless disciples,

27
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,869
"You must make sure
they never meet again."

28
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,121
"That is your fate."

29
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,586
OCTOBER 2005
INDIA-PAKISTAN BORDER

30
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,141
I've finally figured out
where the sarira casket is in the desert.

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,935
If I manage to find it,

32
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,856
I can prove that the legend
of the Diamond Sutra is actually true.

33
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,853
A relic, which can prove the legend
of the Diamond Sutra, has been discovered.

34
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,982
The Buddhist world
is paying close attention to this.

35
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,610
The radiocarbon-dating results are out.

36
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,238
Professor Kim is suspected
of forging the relic.

37
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,907
They will take legal action against him.

38
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,784
…disagrees with results…

39
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,079
The carbon in the black sarira casket
was synthesized recently…

40
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:52,166
The sarira casket forgery case
caused quite a stir back in 2005.

41
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,252
Due to Professor Kim's bizarre behavior…

42
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,462
AFTER THE RELIC FORGERY CASE

43
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,143
1ST SUPER BLUE BLOOD MOON IN 35 YRS.

44
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,187
14 YEARS LATER

45
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,607
RED MOON TO BE SEEN TONIGHT

46
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:26,367
TOTAL LUNAR ECLIPSE
FOR 2 HOURS STARTING AT 1:00 AM

47
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,164
The sarira casket is fake?

48
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,583
And the legend is a lie?

49
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,461
What do you people even know?

50
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,212
You idiots…

51
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:40,923
I was not wrong.

52
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,802
That's right! I wasn't wrong.

53
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,723
You people are the ones
who got it all wrong!

54
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,898
I'll prove that the legend
was true after all.

55
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,497
"Do not awaken what lies asleep here."

56
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,043
"On the night of the Red Moon,

57
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,879
the Red One will be roused from sleep

58
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,758
and return to the Black One."

59
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:29,305
"When they are reunited,

60
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,975
the world will turn into hell,

61
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,813
where only pain and darkness exist."

62
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,216
Now, the door to hell will open.

63
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,969
The door to hell.

64
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,539
I wasn't wrong.

65
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,750
I was not wrong.

66
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,501
Seonhwa,

67
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,128
it's time.

68
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:24,355
THE FIRST DAY

69
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
SAFELY STORE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
TO ENSURE SAFETY

70
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,006
What was he before?

71
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,424
I heard he was a monk.

72
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,217
-A monk?
-Yes.

73
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,302
A Buddhist monk?

74
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,304
Really?

75
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,187
BUK-SAN, GWANGJU

76
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,660
VOW OF SILENCE: SILENT MEDITATION

77
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,224
Cheongseok.

78
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,743
Cheongseok, you've been silent
for about two years, right?

79
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,585
Isn't it difficult?

80
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,755
Of course.

81
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,967
It is harder to train yourself
not to do something that you can do.

82
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,429
WHEN CAN I STOP?

83
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,476
What do you think?
Until I tell you to stop, obviously.

84
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:31,816
Follow me.

85
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,340
Cheongseok.

86
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,179
Remember the story about the monster?

87
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,818
WHY DIDN'T THE BUDDHA
GET RID OF THE MONSTER?

88
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,322
Because they exist

89
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,284
but don't exist at the same time.

90
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,789
So the Buddha locked them up
far away from each other

91
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,958
so they could never meet again.

92
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,961
One in the Far West,

93
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,380
and the other one in the Far East.

94
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,258
He created a desert in the Far West

95
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,220
and locked it up there,
so no one could reach it.

96
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,601
In the Far East, he created
steep cliffs to lock up the other one.

97
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,439
Then the Buddha sent
two of his disciples to the East,

98
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,444
a virgin shaman and a nameless monk.

99
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,614
He told them to guard
the trails and the cliffs

100
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,909
so the two monsters
would never be reunited again.

101
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,952
But…

102
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,039
when the time comes,

103
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:15,377
the Red One in the West
will meet a helper.

104
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,630
On the night of the Red Moon,

105
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,050
the Red One will be freed.

106
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,011
It will then make its way back

107
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,805
through the seven stepping stones
for seven nights

108
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,975
and find its other half.

109
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,687
If they're reunited

110
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,191
on the eighth night…

111
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,569
We can't get rid of the monster,

112
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,200
but we can make sure
the two can't be reunited.

113
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,041
We can get rid of the stepping stones.

114
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,004
If we manage to get rid of
even just one of them,

115
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,799
those two can never be reunited.

116
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,803
Cheongseok.

117
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,766
I see dust piled up on the Urna.

118
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,937
Wipe it clean.

119
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,041
CHILGOK, GYEONGSANGBUK-DO

120
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,597
Damn it. It's tiny.

121
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,987
What's that?

122
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
THE SECOND DAY

123
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,806
-What does he do?
-Not sure. He said he's a professor.

124
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,060
-How did you meet him?
-Through a meditation group.

125
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,897
They say it's a meditation group,
but it was more like a cult.

126
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,900
My life's a mess,

127
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,277
so I went there
thinking it might be helpful.

128
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,906
And? Was it helpful?

129
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,532
Helpful?

130
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,536
Well, I guess so.
Got a health checkup for free.

131
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,957
-A health checkup?
-Nothing expensive.

132
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,959
Just a simple, quick blood test.

133
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,794
That's why you went there?

134
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,171
Of course not.

135
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,091
The organizer paid me
to keep attending the gatherings.

136
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,510
-They paid you?
-Yes.

137
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:28,320
FOUR SEASONS

138
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,743
Did you have a nightmare?

139
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,164
Cheongseok.

140
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,212
Good or bad, everything that's past
is nothing but a vain dream.

141
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,591
Do not let such dreams sway you.

142
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,720
The time has come.

143
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,514
Find Seonhwa.

144
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,891
SEONHWA

145
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,268
And tell him…

146
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,938
that the monster is here.

147
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:16,011
THE THIRD DAY

148
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:22,267
FOUR SEASONS - WELCOME

149
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,859
Hey, you got a photo of this shoeprint?

150
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,655
-I'll check now!
-What have you guys been doing? Jeez.

151
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,407
Hey, this tape should go
all the way around.

152
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,201
-Yes, sir.
-What the heck is this?

153
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,051
-Who called it in?
-The owner of the motel.

154
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,221
-Are there any witnesses?
-This place is very remote.

155
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,515
And it's a weekday, so no other guests.

156
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,352
-They're for your feet.
-What is this?

157
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,856
The owner of the motel was asleep
at the time of the incident.

158
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,315
Did you check that thing?

159
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,778
Yes. Around 11:45 p.m. last night,
the suspect… I mean, the victim.

160
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,031
-Which one is it?
-You're not making any sense.

161
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,783
Go check yourself.

162
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,583
There's a male body inside the bathroom.
The woman who was with him is gone.

163
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,625
Jeez…

164
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
The woman?

165
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:34,506
This man and a woman named Seo Gyeong-suk
checked in together.

166
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,301
The CCTV caught her leaving
right after the incident.

167
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,886
How did you get her name?

168
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,055
She left her stuff, including her wallet.

169
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,391
-Is there an APB out on her?
-Yes.

170
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,864
What is that?

171
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,658
That's the "suspect" I mentioned earlier.

172
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,329
From what I saw in the footage,
he was fine until he entered the room.

173
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,290
But as you can see now, he is…

174
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,585
SEONHWA

175
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,463
Shouldn't we let Seonhwa know?

176
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,423
-Do you know where he is?
-Yes.

177
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,928
-Don't tell him.
-But Bhante Hajeong is--

178
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,095
Don't bother.

179
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,516
Then what about his cremation rite?

180
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,145
No one cares about his death anyway,
so let's keep it simple.

181
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,068
Vow of silence?

182
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,946
For how long?

183
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,410
No one's making you
do it now, so you can stop.

184
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,624
DO YOU KNOW WHERE BHANTE SEONHWA IS?

185
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,888
I WILL BE BACK BEFORE THE CREMATION RITE
- CHEONGSEOK

186
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,946
Bhante Seonhwa.

187
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,032
Bhante, my foot.

188
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,743
He's not a monk?

189
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,707
-Can only a monk ascend us?
-How much longer do we have to wait?

190
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,583
Why doesn't he help us ascend?

191
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,544
You can help us ascend
even if you're not a monk, right?

192
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:43,760
Let us go! Why won't you let us go?

193
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,600
Help us ascend.

194
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,396
THE FOURTH DAY

195
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,940
DAEJEON STATION

196
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,541
EUNHAENG-DONG, DAEJEON
4-91

197
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,574
Seo Gyeong-suk was found dead
inside a restroom at a park.

198
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,375
Let's think simply.

199
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,670
These two checked in together.

200
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,172
And this man came in later.

201
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:07,385
It'd make sense
if these two were found dead.

202
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,596
But this guy was found dead.

203
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,016
She left the motel in one piece,

204
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,310
but didn't take her stuff
or call the police.

205
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,647
Then she was found dead today,
in a restroom.

206
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,233
Looking gross like the body at the motel.

207
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,945
What do you think happened?

208
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,949
What's your theory? You, tell us.

209
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,036
-Me?
-Yes, you.

210
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,581
Well…

211
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,210
It's a bizarre case,

212
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,838
and the bodies
that have been found look weird.

213
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,880
Right.

214
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,884
That said, my friend at the East Precinct…

215
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,386
He said…

216
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,683
-Nothing. Never mind, sir.
-Just finish your sentence.

217
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,018
-What did your friend say?
-I mean…

218
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,356
When he was trying
to catch a flasher recently,

219
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,358
he went to see a famous shaman--

220
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,442
A shaman?

221
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,237
He said she was good.

222
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,948
Are we trying to
catch ghosts here or what?

223
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,326
CHIEF

224
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,833
EVALUATION FOR PROMOTION

225
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,668
What are you going to do about Dong-jin?

226
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,296
You need to do something about him.

227
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,092
Yeah.

228
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,180
It's hard enough
with a perfectly healthy guy.

229
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,974
He limps and can't see well.
What will you do with him?

230
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,395
I got so frustrated yesterday
and told him to quit,

231
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,398
but he wanted to talk to you.

232
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,861
It's not your fault that he's like that.
It was an accident.

233
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,573
So stop making things
harder for the others

234
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,575
and let him go now, okay?

235
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,416
Why does he always ask us to pack this?

236
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,919
To give to his dog, I guess?

237
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,589
The police suspects suicide
and said an investigation is underway.

238
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,965
Coming up next,

239
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,385
a man in his sixties who was arrested
after assaulting his friend…

240
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,942
BHANTE SEONHWA?

241
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,993
BHANTE HAJEONG HAS PASSED AWAY.

242
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,921
HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
THAT THE MONSTER IS HERE.

243
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:09,586
I'M SORRY. I LOST THE THING
BHANTE HAJEONG LEFT BEHIND.

244
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,076
You must be the one
from the meditation group.

245
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,967
Is everything okay?

246
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,762
What happened to you?

247
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,703
VIRGIN SHAMAN

248
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:49,120
Your eyes are still filled with anger.

249
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,459
I figured I should see you,
so I came with him.

250
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,132
I told you over and over.

251
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,720
You must help souls ascend until you die.
That is your fate.

252
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,225
Look, Seonhwa.

253
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,814
I see that there are countless souls
on your back, waiting to ascend.

254
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,154
He is here.

255
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,741
He's already begun
jumping over the stepping stones.

256
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,120
Find her. The only stepping stone we know.

257
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,582
That woman, the virgin shaman.

258
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,379
You must find her before he gets there.

259
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,256
And…

260
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,424
kill her.

261
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,789
It is the fate of those
who must stand guard.

262
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,005
You will be my successor.

263
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,433
VIRGIN SHAMAN

264
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,311
45-12 SINPUNG-DONG, PALDAL-GU, SUWON

265
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:02,253
TO MR. PARK JIN-SU

266
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:23,107
THE FIFTH DAY

267
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,388
Bhante Seonhwa!

268
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,517
Thank you.

269
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,187
VOW OF SILENCE

270
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,324
Where are you going?

271
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,497
What is that?

272
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,084
Where are you headed?

273
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,837
Seo, a female in her forties and also
the suspect in the Daegu motel murder

274
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,799
was found dead in a park restroom.

275
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:57,386
The police are going through
the CCTV footage to retrace Seo's trail

276
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,639
in the hopes of finding witnesses.

277
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,808
The police suspect another accomplice may…

278
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,024
No, thanks.

279
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,527
May I go with you?

280
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,116
Bhante Hajeong told me to stay with you.

281
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,669
46-9 SINPUNG-DONG, PALDAL-GU

282
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:31,522
By the way, have we met before?

283
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,610
I feel comfortable
around you for some reason,

284
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,863
as if we've met before.

285
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:44,702
I'm not saying this
because you bought me nice shoes…

286
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,289
and food.

287
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,958
That's not why I'm saying it.

288
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,710
What I mean is…

289
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,887
You have sinned a lot.

290
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,533
Looking for someone?

291
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:35,878
Well…

292
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,007
The lady at the store said
you were looking for the shaman.

293
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,845
I heard she moved to Daegu a year ago.

294
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,349
Her address? That, I don't know.

295
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,353
But if you go there,

296
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,730
you'll die.

297
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,440
What do you mean?

298
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,527
NFS performed an autopsy
and even did a toxicology test,

299
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,320
but the cause of death is unknown.

300
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,947
Then how did they die?

301
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,743
-There are some things on the report--
-Just say it! Don't keep me hanging!

302
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,164
"The bodies decomposed overnight
and resulted in severe tissue damage…"

303
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,792
-What is this?
-What's this nonsense now?

304
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,544
What else?

305
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,298
It says that each victim
has a dent in their skull.

306
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,843
But they have to look into it more.

307
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,596
-Hey.
-Yes, we're at the scene.

308
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,391
Are you sure you called the NFS,

309
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,810
not a private
investigation agency somewhere?

310
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,896
Sir, I saw the bodies
again today, you know?

311
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,606
But it's really bizarre.

312
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,527
Remember the shaman
I told you about the other day?

313
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,488
-I went to see--
-You're at it again? I'm hanging up.

314
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,035
Have you put out an APB on the suspect?

315
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,578
-Yes, sir.
-Who's the victim?

316
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,247
Female, 28.
She was reported missing two days ago.

317
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,083
She went to see a friend
and never came back.

318
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,003
-Currently unemployed and…
-The dead don't work.

319
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,421
Pardon?

320
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,928
Jeez, it stinks.

321
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,683
-Pass me the gloves.
-Yes, sir.

322
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,453
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

323
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,341
WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

324
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,016
Jeez, you're so annoying.

325
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,728
See all the empty seats?
Why must you sit beside me?

326
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,823
-Just talk.
-Can I?

327
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,036
-Bhante Seonhwa, I thought it'd annoy--
-Don't call me that.

328
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,123
Pardon? Then what should I call you?

329
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,852
DAEGU BUS TERMINAL

330
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:27,359
I am choosing death to pay for what I did.

331
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,237
I know it's a lot to ask, but please,

332
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,407
look after my son, Jeong-hun,
who now has no one.

333
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:38,913
Once again, I'd like to apologize
to Mr. Park Jin-su and his family.

334
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,831
I am sorry.

335
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,209
-Kill him.
-Just kill him. Eye for an eye.

336
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,585
Kill him!

337
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,129
Just kill him!

338
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,131
Kill him!

339
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,425
You fool!

340
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,806
THE SIXTH DAY

341
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,268
Bhante Seonhwa.

342
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,156
Bhante Seonhwa.

343
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,495
I'm sorry.
You told me not to call you that.

344
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,539
What should I--

345
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:07,710
Did Bhante Hajeong
really tell you to stay with me?

346
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,142
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

347
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,149
The motel, the restroom.

348
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,249
Are you a baby?

349
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,668
Do this yourself.

350
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,266
That's a double burger.

351
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,781
Listen up. See this area here?

352
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,034
We'll find every single shaman here today.

353
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,162
The public restroom
in the park is over there,

354
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,666
so you check from here
all the way to Gyobang-dong…

355
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,754
Here's your ice cream.

356
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,966
You little punk.

357
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,394
Find all of them
before sundown and meet me here.

358
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,901
-Is it good?
-Yes, it's so good.

359
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,446
I had ice cream
when Bhante Hajeong took me to…

360
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
GYOBANG GIL 91
GYOBANG 2-GIL 37 - 141

361
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,684
GEUMJEONGSA

362
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:33,689
WOMAN'S DEAD BODY FOUND
IN SEWER BY DAEGU TUNNEL

363
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,192
Due to the level of decomposition,

364
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,070
the police believe
that the incident took place a while ago…

365
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,492
VIRGIN SHAMAN

366
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,983
-Where are you, sir?
-At the scene. Why?

367
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:22,779
-Chief is looking for you.
-Okay. I'll be back in a bit.

368
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,002
Emergency near Jangan-dong.
We're on the way.

369
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,784
Excuse me.

370
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,829
May I see your ID?

371
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,302
-It's me.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,012
Can you look someone up?

373
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:33,684
Park Jin-su, 750121-1046411.

374
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,772
Patrol 7 here. Another body found
near Daegu High School.

375
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,027
Just a fine for causing
a disturbance in court. That's all.

376
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:44,945
Okay.

377
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,035
Just a second.

378
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,663
May I check your bag?

379
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,691
Damn it.

380
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,160
Is there any chance…

381
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,246
that we've met before?

382
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,061
DAEGU JUNGBU POLICE

383
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,188
Are you all right?

384
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,981
Did you check?

385
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,194
First off, the body found
near Daegu High School

386
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:15,906
was the delivery guy from the tunnel.
The body was in the same condition.

387
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,909
What the heck is happening here?

388
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,833
And here.

389
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,084
NAME: PARK JIN-SU

390
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,587
He was working
at a construction site in Daejeon

391
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,839
up until two days before the first case.

392
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,966
I spoke with the site manager.

393
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,053
In March 1999, he lost his wife

394
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:41,556
and his five-year-old daughter
in a car accident.

395
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,226
The driver was under
the influence of alcohol.

396
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,394
The driver got her sentence reduced…

397
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,522
And he caused
a disturbance in court. Okay.

398
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,607
"Assault"? What's this about?

399
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,027
I think this man
became a monk after the accident.

400
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,237
A Buddhist monk?

401
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,823
There's a small temple
in Gwangju, Jeolla Province.

402
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,742
Apparently, it's famous for exorcism--

403
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,203
-Another shaman?
-No, he's not a shaman.

404
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,539
I'd say he's an exorcist monk?

405
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,166
Stop writing a novel and get to the point.

406
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,668
The point is,

407
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:12,504
he beat someone up
to expel an evil spirit.

408
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,256
And got charged with assault.

409
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,635
They reached a settlement.
And this fraud charge?

410
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,973
The Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism
checked after helping him settle the case

411
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,892
and found out Park was never
ordained as a Buddhist monk.

412
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,394
He was never ordained?

413
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,564
Simply put, that's how
you obtain your ID as a Buddhist monk.

414
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,692
If he doesn't have that,
it means he's not a real monk.

415
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,445
Who is this prick?

416
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,492
DAEGU JUNGBU POLICE PRECINCT MAP

417
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,247
Damn it.

418
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,250
Anyway, this morning in Chilgok--

419
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,168
-Hey, Dong-jin.
-Yes?

420
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,212
Let's go.

421
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,973
Come with me.

422
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,643
Right.

423
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,771
Before I forget… Here.

424
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:16,276
-What is this?
-Clean underwear. Courtesy of my wife.

425
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:20,155
My goodness, she didn't have to do this.

426
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:23,283
And before I forget, here. Take this, too.

427
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,118
What's this?

428
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:28,747
I told you last time
about the virgin shaman.

429
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,707
-You idiot.
-No, don't!

430
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,961
It was very expensive.
It's not just any talisman.

431
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,255
See this?

432
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,050
My blood went into it
to make it even more effective.

433
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,803
-My own blood.
-Is this what you've been doing?

434
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,806
Come on. Just keep it on you at all times.

435
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,435
It'll ward off evil spirits
and help you catch the killer.

436
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:54,856
Then why do detectives even exist?
Shamans could catch the bad guys.

437
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,525
Hey, what did you say to me a while back?

438
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,445
You said we should try everything we can.

439
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,831
How are you feeling?

440
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,209
Better?

441
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:19,547
Well, my legs are much better now,
and my eyes, too.

442
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:24,260
The light has turned green.
You may cross now.

443
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,184
Ho-tae, you really
don't need to worry about me.

444
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:34,270
It was an accident.
It's not your fault that I got hurt.

445
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,024
You saved me when I jumped
in the water to kill myself.

446
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,151
And thanks to you, I became a cop.

447
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,782
Even if it was your fault
that I ended up like this,

448
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,202
I honestly wouldn't care.

449
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:55,083
So I'm just going to keep
working as a cop, okay?

450
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:57,919
MAP OF DAEGU

451
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,131
Did you see a virgin shaman in this area?

452
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:09,472
This is the park.
I went this way, and you this way.

453
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,183
Right there.

454
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,436
On the right.

455
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,396
It's here.

456
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,740
But I saw something strange
on my way back.

457
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,575
SUSEONG-GU

458
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,371
SEO-GU, JUNG-GU

459
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,706
What is this?

460
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,293
His face turned green when he heard
about the body on radio.

461
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,544
Pass me a pen.

462
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,136
The tunnel is here.

463
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,014
Daegu High School.

464
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,558
Gyobang-dong?

465
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,852
No new missing person reports
in the past few days.

466
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,813
This one's the only runaway.
But it's nothing new.

467
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:02,984
She's done this many times.
She usually comes home in a few weeks.

468
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,404
Her mother brought it about a year ago.

469
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,533
She made quite a scene and said
that her daughter would kill herself.

470
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,659
Kill herself?

471
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,413
Yes. She joined some kind of
suicide website and disappeared.

472
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:20,293
But from what I recall,
she returned home safely a few days later.

473
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:23,296
-Right?
-It wasn't a suicide website.

474
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:27,217
We found out later
it was a meditation group

475
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,095
created by people
who had attempted suicide.

476
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,142
You really saw that?

477
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,812
Are you sure?

478
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,527
What exactly did I see?

479
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,571
Listen carefully.

480
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:53,034
We're parting ways here.
We never met and you never even saw me.

481
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,456
If anyone asks, you don't know me.
Say you don't know me at all.

482
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:05,004
But I do know you.

483
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,632
I'll go with you…

484
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,887
-Go back to the temple.
-I don't want to.

485
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,390
I came all the way here.

486
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:19,519
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but I want to help.

487
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,694
I have to…

488
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,532
kill someone now.

489
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,369
If you stay with me,
you'll get in trouble.

490
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,788
You understand me?

491
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,835
The person you must kill…

492
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,423
-Is it the thing I saw?
-No, he can't be killed.

493
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,842
Then who…

494
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,193
If he's really been awakened,

495
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,071
she'll die at the hands
of that monster anyway.

496
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,950
-I don't understand.
-I don't have time to explain.

497
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,327
I must…

498
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,247
get rid of what he needs.

499
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,169
That's all I can do.

500
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,092
As for what happened in the past…

501
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,831
-Aren't you coming?
-No, you get going first.

502
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,416
All right.

503
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,129
Right, there was something
I wanted to tell you about.

504
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,256
What is it?

505
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,592
This morning, they found a dead body
in the mountains in Chilgok.

506
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:19,055
-They said that the body looked bizarre.
-How so?

507
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,140
Based on the description,

508
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,643
it sounded similar
to the victims in this case.

509
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,229
-Have you checked?
-I'm already on it.

510
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:29,357
The phone records,
e-mails, and bank records. You name it.

511
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,276
What do you say?

512
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,987
Am I competent enough
to keep working with you?

513
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,572
Just go home.

514
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,225
Come with me.

515
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,395
You have to run.

516
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,605
No time to explain.

517
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,315
Come on.

518
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,868
-What's up?
-It's about the body found in Chilgok.

519
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,788
-I think it's connected to this case.
-Go on.

520
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,416
Name, Kim Jun-cheol. An anthropologist.

521
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:54,711
Shunned by academia after
the relic forgery case 13 years ago.

522
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:55,878
From 2016 onwards,

523
01:01:55,962 --> 01:02:00,049
he ran a Buddhist meditation website
called BMS up until a year ago,

524
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,759
and they were all members of this site.

525
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,221
-"They"? Who?
-The weird-looking corpses.

526
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:09,517
On the website, there are a few photos
from their offline gathering in Daegu.

527
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,311
Except for two people,
everyone in the photos

528
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,564
was found dead in that grotesque state.

529
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,693
But the thing is,
do you know who those two people are?

530
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:22,321
-Who are they?
-I was so surprised when I saw this photo.

531
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,950
The runaway girl
we heard about at the substation earlier.

532
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:29,120
The other is the shaman
who made that talisman I gave you.

533
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,789
-They're the two people.
-Where are you now?

534
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,332
I'm at the office.

535
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,170
Give me the shaman's address.

536
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,339
Gyobang-dong, right? Meet me there.

537
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,242
You bastard.

538
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,580
I won't lose you twice.

539
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,110
She already ran away.

540
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,112
That sly bitch.

541
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,562
OM

542
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,218
-It's over now.
-He'll die soon.

543
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:57,346
-He's done for.
-Useless prick.

544
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,390
He's useless now.

545
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,268
Help us ascend? As if.

546
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,896
-What was the point of waiting?
-Let's go.

547
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,079
Why isn't he picking up?

548
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,584
That's weird.
I'm pretty sure I came this way last time.

549
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:45,061
What's going on? Is that the runaway girl?

550
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,525
-What's wrong?
-Over there.

551
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,534
Don't move.

552
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,704
Drop your weapon. I said, drop it!

553
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,331
Call from an alleyway,
Gyobang 3-dong redevelopment area.

554
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,959
This is Patrol 8.
We're near that area now.

555
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,335
We'll head over.

556
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:43,197
This is not where you'll die.

557
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,116
Go to Buk-San.

558
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:03,634
You two over there.
What are you doing here?

559
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,149
Hey, get him!

560
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,154
This is Patrol 8.
Send backup to Gyobang 3-dong.

561
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:00,691
Here.

562
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,049
Two for Gwangju, please.

563
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:32,348
THE SEVENTH DAY

564
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,607
Bhante Hajeong?

565
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:02,211
GO TO BUK-SAN AND
YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

566
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:08,217
-To Gwangju, please.
-Go to the terminal to get there.

567
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:12,221
-Then can you drop me off at the terminal?
-Sure.

568
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:23,482
Taxi!

569
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,235
Taxi.

570
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,706
-Gwangju, please.
-Last one just left.

571
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,041
Next one is in three hours.

572
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,007
JUNE 13, 2:01 A.M.

573
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:03,689
GO TO BUK-SAN AND
YOU'LL FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

574
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,775
The last stepping stone I was looking for.

575
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,904
That woman, the virgin shaman.

576
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,782
But why…

577
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,583
Are you afraid?

578
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,713
Right. Everyone runs away

579
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,299
when faced with fear.

580
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,514
Look.

581
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:42,769
They all left, thinking you'd die soon.

582
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,149
That means…

583
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,111
he is already on the last stepping stone.

584
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,701
Now, you are the only one that's left.

585
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,079
Like I said,

586
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,500
whether you run away alive or dead,

587
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,920
your fate as the guard will not end.

588
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:14,301
You became the guard because I died.

589
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,637
So if you run away or die,

590
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,057
someone else
will take over as your successor.

591
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:22,809
Bhante Seonhwa!

592
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,064
Now, the choice is yours.

593
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,399
Mister.

594
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,860
I'm sorry.

595
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:36,198
But why did my mom die?

596
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,049
JUNE 13, 4:54 A.M.

597
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,179
To Gwangju, please.

598
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,963
That makes no sense!

599
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:36,508
Why would he do such a thing
when he has a wife and a kid?

600
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,260
Let's just wait.

601
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:42,973
Maybe someone stole
Dong-jin's car and gun.

602
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:46,143
Move.

603
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,523
PLATE NUMBER: 23S 7657

604
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:02,367
To Buk-San, please.

605
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:21,928
Maybe that's why the head monk said
we should keep it simple…

606
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,059
I'll call you later.

607
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,328
Hey!

608
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,499
What are you doing?

609
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:52,250
What…

610
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,472
What will you do now?

611
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:09,601
Both he and the sarira casket
are on their way back here now.

612
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,208
Have you found any witnesses yet?

613
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,210
They heard some people fight

614
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,963
and called the police,
but didn't really see anything.

615
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:39,631
I don't care.

616
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,260
Just find evidence
that it wasn't Dong-jin.

617
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:44,594
Yes, sir.

618
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:12,038
Are you getting tired?

619
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,039
I'm Cheongseok.

620
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:58,210
It means green grass.

621
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,129
My name is…

622
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:03,757
Ae-ran.

623
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:35,831
Were you here alone?

624
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,838
When I first met her,

625
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,090
I didn't know she was a ghost.

626
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:51,513
No one there knew
that she was there with us.

627
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:04,359
That night, she followed me.

628
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,364
Then all night, she told me what happened.

629
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:15,078
An abused girl.
She believed that life was a curse.

630
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:19,416
She wished that all of it
would just end quickly.

631
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,669
Then one day,

632
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:26,339
a man showed up like her savior.

633
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,135
Let's go.

634
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,765
But happiness is always short-lived.

635
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:40,103
And always…

636
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:42,689
No! That is not true!

637
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:48,028
No. I am not wrong.

638
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:51,489
This is what it says here.

639
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,618
"The one who
bewitches the virgin, the red-eyed maid."

640
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:59,122
I need this maid
as a sacrificial offering.

641
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:00,957
Do you think I'm crazy?

642
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,461
Even if no one believes me,

643
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,213
you believe Daddy, right?

644
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:16,723
The virgin shaman who guards
the path will be the last stepping stone.

645
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:19,893
A sacrificial offering.

646
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,271
Someone who can bewitch the virgin

647
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:25,899
and stall her.

648
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,330
Even if no one believes me,

649
01:22:41,414 --> 01:22:42,958
you believe Daddy, right?

650
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,297
If it's something

651
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:52,217
that someone you love said,

652
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,970
you always want to believe it,

653
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:59,307
no matter how foolish it is.

654
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:14,197
Is that why life is a tragedy?

655
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:30,547
-Why is this…
-Why is it there?

656
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,187
Two for Gwangju, please.

657
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,359
To Buk-San, please.

658
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,204
That detective?

659
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:07,333
He was here a few days ago.

660
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:11,296
I made him a talisman with his blood.

661
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:13,131
But the thing is…

662
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:16,426
he didn't seem to know
he was already dead.

663
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,636
That meditation group…

664
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,973
Everyone there had no idea either.

665
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:26,478
That they were all
destined to die years ago.

666
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:32,859
They were alive because they couldn't die.
They were hanging by a thread.

667
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,404
I don't know
how that professor found them.

668
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,574
He brought them all together.

669
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,368
Then he used them

670
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:45,288
as sacrificial offerings,
as the stepping stones.

671
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,625
The Red One

672
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:52,545
will follow the smell of their blood

673
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:57,092
and step on the stepping stones one by one

674
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,970
to go to the Black One.

675
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:03,765
Then…

676
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:17,570
What are you doing?

677
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,744
That detective
has the same natal chart as mine.

678
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,704
So he became the stepping stone for me.

679
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,332
That girl kept me here so I couldn't run.

680
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:33,753
Ae-ran told me in secret
that I'd be able to live if I did that.

681
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:37,757
Even so, it's not my fault
that cop ended up like that. It's…

682
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:45,014
the person who
pulled him out of the water…

683
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:48,768
It was you.

684
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:52,772
Because of you, he couldn't die
when he was supposed to die.

685
01:25:56,943 --> 01:26:00,071
Then it's your fault, not mine.

686
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,365
Figure it out yourself, then.
Why come to me?

687
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:10,081
Go to Buk-San.

688
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:15,461
Those who are chained
all went to the one holding the chain.

689
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:18,882
They're all his now.

690
01:26:24,637 --> 01:26:25,805
Leave.

691
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:29,225
I have nowhere to go.

692
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,150
Fine.

693
01:26:39,485 --> 01:26:40,361
But…

694
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:47,076
we will now set up a trap to catch him.

695
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,663
I'll use myself as bait.

696
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:55,251
No matter what he does
once he's in the trap,

697
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:57,587
do only what I say.

698
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,093
I'll turn your clothes into your talisman,

699
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,678
so do not take them off.

700
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:19,359
Go to Buk-San,

701
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:21,486
and you'll find what you're looking for.

702
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,821
Am I competent enough
to keep working with you?

703
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,865
So I'm just going to keep
working as a cop, okay?

704
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,535
DAEGU

705
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:52,558
What will happen
when the sarira casket is open?

706
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:58,398
The Black One and the Red One
will be reunited again.

707
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:03,528
What are the Black One and the Red One?

708
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:07,031
Anxiety is what you feel
when you live in anguish

709
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:10,618
while waiting for the unknown.

710
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,706
The eyes of an anxious person
look dark, devoid of any spark.

711
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,293
Agony is what you feel when you're sad

712
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,462
because you can't get over
something that happened in the past.

713
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:26,509
The eyes of a person suffering
from such agony burn with anger.

714
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,055
Therefore, anxiety is black,

715
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:34,183
and agony is red.

716
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,941
Such formless black and red things

717
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:44,652
make us suffer so much.

718
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:50,742
What do you think will happen
if they're reunited and become one?

719
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:59,000
A world where both the living and the dead
suffer in despair and anger,

720
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,918
trapped in anxiety and agony.

721
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:04,130
A world of endless night.

722
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:09,719
That is…

723
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,512
That is hell.

724
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:22,106
THE EIGHTH DAY

725
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,744
We have nowhere to run.

726
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:18,282
I'll be his last target.

727
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:22,828
When he crawls into my body
once he's caught inside the trap…

728
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:26,290
Slay me without hesitation.

729
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:53,150
You are foolish.

730
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:59,657
My final destination is the body
of the one who can open the sarira casket.

731
01:33:00,574 --> 01:33:04,954
Only the one who guards
the sarira casket can open it.

732
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:07,707
The day you became a monk in Buk-San,

733
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,334
you became Hajeong's successor,

734
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,170
the only person
who can open the sarira casket.

735
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:16,340
However,

736
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:20,428
because you left
this mountain and ran away,

737
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:27,560
you can no longer open
the sarira casket. Hajeong's successor is…

738
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,153
OM

739
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:39,488
Which means,

740
01:33:40,656 --> 01:33:43,284
no one needs you anymore.

741
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,829
You're useless.

742
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:50,541
So…

743
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:55,379
just die.

744
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:11,937
Ae-ran, find him.

745
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:30,039
Ae-ran!

746
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:40,966
OM

747
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:14,375
Dong-jin!

748
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:16,335
Park Dong-jin!

749
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:38,626
Jeong-hun! Run!

750
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,337
Run!

751
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:38,829
You asshole.

752
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:43,584
What's wrong with you?
What were you thinking?

753
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:05,147
-Ho-tae, run. Get out of here.
-Dong-jin.

754
01:39:30,589 --> 01:39:32,508
Stay away!

755
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,276
Run!

756
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:57,241
Bhante Seonhwa, help me!

757
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,079
Bhante Seonhwa!

758
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:49,543
Dong-jin.

759
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,363
You're so annoying.

760
01:41:37,257 --> 01:41:42,012
Ho-tae.

761
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:47,142
Let's…

762
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:49,812
go home.

763
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:11,208
Just come to me.

764
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:16,713
This kid… Don't hurt him.

765
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:19,424
I guess you forgot.

766
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,845
This boy is the son
of the woman you used to hate.

767
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:27,808
What do you think you'll mean to this boy?

768
01:43:05,804 --> 01:43:06,847
Let's go.

769
01:43:26,074 --> 01:43:27,576
The light is…

770
01:43:29,202 --> 01:43:30,370
too…

771
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:33,415
far.

772
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:49,097
My mom killed your entire family.

773
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:52,517
I'm sure you wanted her
to suffer the same.

774
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:55,145
It's not too late yet.

775
01:43:55,938 --> 01:43:57,773
This is your last chance.

776
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:03,153
Your last chance to put an end
to everything once and for all.

777
01:44:04,446 --> 01:44:09,159
Do not give up
like the night you left the temple.

778
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:15,040
Strangle me with all your strength.

779
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:21,797
Then those nights that felt like hell

780
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,758
will all disappear.

781
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:18,520
You gave up your last chance

782
01:45:18,603 --> 01:45:21,440
to put an end to your pent-up
anguish and resentment.

783
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:25,402
You are still unbelievably foolish.

784
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,996
OM

785
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:25,504
Jeong-hun!

786
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:38,850
I'm sorry…

787
01:46:42,729 --> 01:46:44,106
for everything.

788
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:54,843
When the darkness deepens,
the light becomes even brighter.

789
01:47:57,429 --> 01:48:01,099
The deeper the agony,
the greater the nirvana will be.

790
01:48:04,769 --> 01:48:07,063
What is life?

791
01:48:11,067 --> 01:48:13,945
Life is like a short-lived flower.

792
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:22,120
All your dreams
and fantasies are like sea foam,

793
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:27,918
like shadows, dewdrops, and lightning.

794
01:48:29,211 --> 01:48:31,463
It is truly futile.

795
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:40,597
But even if it's a futile, fleeting moment
in our predetermined fate,

796
01:48:41,431 --> 01:48:44,893
everything is meaningful in its own way.

797
01:49:11,086 --> 01:49:12,170
Seonhwa.

798
01:49:14,256 --> 01:49:16,549
Now that you've found that meaning,

799
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,763
it's time for you to wake up
from your sad dream.
