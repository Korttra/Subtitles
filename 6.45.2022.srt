00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,730
How many shots are coming?

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,120
I think 20 shots.

9
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,660
Son of bitches..

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,900

counter fire!

11
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,360

- Fire!

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,890
How many shots?

14
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,330
Two hundred shots.

15
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,140
These bastards..

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,580
Just go over 500 shots.

17
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,090
Chief of staff!

18
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,430
I think it's 100 shots this time!

19
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,150
Are they crazy?
Are they going to war?

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,490
Blow 200 shots!

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,060
A few years ago, the front unit, which had been pierced in knock order, was pierced again.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,110
It's broke.
Military discipline is broken.

23
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,100
Is the military an army these days?You have to roll it.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,920
-Bang!
-Bang!

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,120

- Good day!

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,190
- Hello!
- Hello!

27
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,280
- Here, here, here!

00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,640
-Bang!
- Now, even the lucky lottery!

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,930
-Bang!
- Thank you!

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,540
Hey, what's the sound?
Still in a war?

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,160
The North is continuing to shoot and provoke, perhaps because of an accident in Cheorwon.

32
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,680
Hey, I'm on my way.

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,430
Don't back down. Push it according to the rules of engagement.

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,610
You're wasting your ammo, you punks.

35
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,040
So far, 3,000 shots have been fired.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,370
Give me another 300 shots.

37
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,430
The second round is on me.

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,620
The 2nd round is...

39
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,460
It's today's mission.

40
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,460
Captain's on his way, you know?

41
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,700
Captain, there're three horse dungs, three.

42
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,140
Go and see where it's coming from. Go!

43
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,770
Can sergeant Park talk to dogs?

44
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,030
Where are you?

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,270
500m?

46
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,610
300m?
OK!

47
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,670
Hey, get ready.

48
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,930
- Loyalty!
- Loyalty!

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,620
- Park Chunwoo! Park Chunwoo!
- Park Chunwoo! Park Chunwoo!

50
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,300
- Park Chunwoo!
- Park Chunwoo! Park Chun...

51
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,460
Holstein, about 18 months.

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,090
- He's stressed out.
- He's stressed out.

53
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,810
It's a bit fishy.

54
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,640
- Holstein, Holstein!
- Hols!

55
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,670
Ayrshire.

56
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,460
Airsher, airsher!
It's Airsher!

57
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,120
Sergeant Park, you're amazing.

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,420
Isn't he like a milk barista?

59
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,630
My house used to have a big ranch.

60
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,580
- Ranch?
- Ranch.

61
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,920
Why do you forget about the foot-and-mouth disease?

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,850
Loyalty!

63
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,580
- Hey, Seongho!
- Yes.

64
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,870
Not going to work, huh?

65
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,890
Hey, if knock defect is coming again you know?
Get moving!

66
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,600
- I got it!
- Hey, hey.

67
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,620
Let's clean this up. Let's go clean up our area!

68
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,540
- Yes, sir!
- Got it!

69
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,380
Come on.

70
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,660
- Move quickly, move, move.

71
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,840
- Yes, sir
- Yes, sir.

72
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,060
Supply officer, are you on duty?

73
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,330
No, it looks like the hols's stuck again.

74
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,390
It's not easy to get water.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,180
- Take care of yourself. Thank you.

76
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,880
- Good day.
- Good luck!

77
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,900
- Hey, bring me the chessboard.
- Yes, sir.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,270
- How many days are left?
- Private Kim Hyunsoo!

79
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,620
97 days.

80
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,960
Oh, 15 hours.

81
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,870
No, 15 hours.
30 minutes are left!

82
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,000
Still?

83
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,560
Yes, right.

84
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,430
What's wrong with this?

85
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,110
Okay, the draw has begun!

86
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,500
The first lucky number is 39.

87
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,660
What's the second
lucky number?

88
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,920
36.

89
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,280
Damn, I got two right.

90
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,000
Here's a draw for the 3rd number.

91
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,070
3!

92
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,790
Yes, 3...
The 4th lucky number.

93
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,260
30.

94
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,790
There are a lot of numbers with 3 letters?

95
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,590
The 5th lucky number is 1!

96
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,270
So, what's the last 6th
lucky number?

97
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,560
The ball is spinning fast...

98
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,320
- Get rid of it.
- Yes, sir!

99
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,770
What are you doing, not preparing for the roll call?

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,360
These guys just lost their themselves.

101
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,100
Don't you wake up?

102
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,100
Hey, hey ...

103
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,520
33!

104
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,290
Now, we'll draw a bonus ball for second place.

105
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,770
- The 934th.
- Hey.

106
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,650
- I'll give you the lottery numbers.
- What's wrong with him?

107
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,980
- //39, //30, //3
- Probably spoiled milk.

108
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,220
You did.

109
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,650
Spoiled milk?

110
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,380
- What's wrong?
- Are you crazy?

111
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,250
Drank spoiled milk?

112
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,960
Spoiled milk?

113
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,890
Crying while laughing.

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,780
Hey, go.

115
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,170
Excuse me, Sergeant Park. Are you okay?

116
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,830
No, because the world is so beautiful.

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,710
Yeah?

118
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,820
Hey, what are you saying?

119
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,250
I don't know.

120
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,700
5.7 billion.

121
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,090
South Korean soldiers.Hello.

122
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,940
How hard is it to work on the front desk all day and night?

123
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,410
We, the guards,

124
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,210
are here with warm love and consideration from the awe-inspiring Commander Comrade.

125
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,090
North Korean soldiers,

126
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,420
there's a weather forecast on the supercomputer of the Korea Meteorological Administration.

127
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,180
It will rain in three hours.

128
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:13,190
With the affection of our compatriots, we inform North Korea that there is no other supercomputer.

129
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,330
Hey, what are we gonna do about this?

130
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,850
According to our North Korean scientific satellite
Gwangmyeongseong No. 2.

131
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,240
It's not raining.

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,320
Our comrade fart man(Bang Kwi Nam) soldier leader and I

133
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,250
have developed a lot of feelings in such a program,

134
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,400
he has no taste and dryness, his name is also very rustic,

135
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,230
we have prepared three lines of poetry for comrade fart man, you wanna hear it?

136
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,260
IU from North Korea prepared an acrostic poem.

137
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,470
Of course I'll have to hear it.

138
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,390
Fart, farting boom boom.

139
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,120
Kwi, Kwi-nam.

140
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,650
Nam, South Korean hot pants.

141
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,150
Hot pants..

142
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,630
Comrade Yeonhee, take it easy.

143
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,860
Since IU sent us an acrostic poem.

144
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,770
I should send you a reply with an acrostic poem.

145
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,170
I know.

146
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,140
IU is the most beautiful singer in South Korea.

147
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,110
Should I say the first letter?
Ah.

148
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,120
She still think

149
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,200
she's pretty.

150
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,720
Yoo, I'm sorry to hear that.

151
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,600
Sergeant Park!

152
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,300
A South Korean soldier who only judges people by their looks.

153
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,600
Don't you have a girlfriend?

154
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,970
You're very angry.

155
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
But even angrier if you heard this?

156
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,850
That's what, 10 years of military service?

157
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,750
What should I do?
I'm about to be discharged.

158
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,520
Where's medicine.

159
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,720
unable to get rid of the nasty sickness.

160
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,240
If you play around like that,

161
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,700
you're likely to end up in an acorn.

162
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,180
Irrational madness.
That's it. Come on!

163
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,010
Come on!

164
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,370
- It's not a coincidence.
- Loyalty!

165
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,210
What's

166
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,940
that?

167
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,000
I think our GP has soldiers of interest.

168
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,250
Soldiers of interest?

169
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,890
Sergeant Park Chun-woo is a bit weird these days.

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,450
Park Chun-woo?

171
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,590
A real rich man doesn't ignore others.

172
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,840
A positive attitude of keeping dignity.

173
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,810
That's the real elite.

174
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,300
It's a good story.

175
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,440
Well, can I go to the bathroom?

176
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,890
Why are you asking me that?
Ask your old man.

177
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,860
It's not small, it's big.

178
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,070
You're doing a good job.
You're not supposed to hold back your shit.

179
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,590
No!

180
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,850
What am I supposed to do?

181
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,970
Welcome, Comrade Lee Yongho.

182
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,680
What are you looking at?

183
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,220
I am just bored watching the German War movie.

184
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,110
Watch it together?

185
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,010
I've memorized everything now.

186
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,090
I should've seen this more than 100 times.

187
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,950
Chol-jin companion.

188
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,000
Can I ask you something?

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,320
I don't know anyone else, but I have to help Lee Yong-ho.

190
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,010
I picked up a piece of South Korean paper.

191
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,330
You know what this is?

192
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,770
It's called 645.

193
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,880
645?

194
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,820
If you get 6 correct out of 45 numbers,

195
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,640
A vicious capitalist exploitation technique

196
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
that fleeces the Korean people in the name of giving them huge amounts of money.

197
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,300
But this is the day of the last drawing.

198
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,920
Is this the latest piece of paper?

199
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,980
Just for fun, take a look.

200
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,190
OK.

201
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,140
Okay, there it is. .

202
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,690
Number one, three, and thirty.

203
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,930
3...

204
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,950
33, 36.

205
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,850
Lastly, number 39.

206
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,470
This is the number one.

207
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,780
What's the matter, Comrade Chol Jin?

208
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,730
It's...

209
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,160
What is this?

210
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,030
Yeah, well...

211
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,780
What should we do?

212
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah?

213
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,890
I almost broke my back.

214
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,570
The temperature is 21 degrees Celsius and the wind is from the northeast.

215
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,030
The wind speed is 14 m /s
A lottery ticket weighs 75 grams.

216
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,750
If you plug in the formula for free fall.

217
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,660
The flight distance of Lotto is 1.23 km.

218
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,170
This is where the lottery is.

219
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,620
What's going on?

220
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,370
What?

221
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,080
Just hand out the flyers!

222
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,080
Oh.

223
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,440
Hello, here.

224
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,850
Put the gun down.

225
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,420
I'm not gonna eat you. Okay?

226
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,980
Come on.

227
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,200
Put the gun down.

228
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,340
What's your name?

229
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,970
It's Park Chunwoo?

230
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,620
My name is Lee Yongho.

231
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,790
Sergeant Lee Yongho.

232
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,250
Sergeant Lee Yongho.

233
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,110
It's been three days since we met.

234
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,770
I came out to meet my South Korean soldier.

235
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,990
Welcome to Free Korea.

236
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,110
What are you talking about, you stupid?

237
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,840
But why do you keep talking informally?

238
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,940
I mean you.

239
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,430
Do you know the game called "645"?

240
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,600
Out of 45 numbers, if you get 6 correct, you'll get 1st place.

241
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,390
I picked up a 645.

242
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,800
This is a piece of paper for first place.

243
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,190
So..

244
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,010
I'll give you 10% if you bring the cash.

245
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,650
I finally found it, thank you!

246
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,860
Hey, North Korean soldier.

247
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,390
That, that's mine.

248
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,070
So give it to me while I'm being nice.

249
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,050
What?

250
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,310
Is this yours?

251
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,340
Yeah, that's how I got here.

252
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,690
Stupid.

253
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,510
934th, right?

254
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,750
- Yeah.
-1, 3, 30.

255
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,410
Number 33, number 36, number 39, right?

256
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,790
Yeah, so it's mine! Give it back!

257
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,820
You Korean boy think I'm hot pants?

258
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,480
And where does this note belong?

259
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,400
Who got it who's the owner.

260
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,650
What does that mean?
What's that?

261
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,220
Sergeant Park Chun-woo.

262
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,160
When is your next shift again?

263
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,460
- What's that?
- Answer me, you jerk!

264
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,210
Three days later, you punk!

265
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,820
I'll see you here in three days.

266
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,210
I'm gonna talk to you here again, okay?

267
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Wait.

268
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,230
It hurts a lot?

269
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,200
No.

270
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,050
Are you... At night..

271
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,420
Did you meet a ghost and wrestled?

272
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,010
No.

273
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,080
But why do you walk around at night like a madman?

274
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,100
And in a minefield you'll find if you go in.

275
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,720
Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't explode?

276
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,150
You cross the bars and you're in the brig by law.

277
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,690
But you'll be discharged in a few months

278
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,360
and you have serious mental health problems.

279
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,570
I'm alright.

280
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,650
No problem at all.

281
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,860
But why cross the barbed wire every night like a madman.

282
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
Wandering around the Demilitarized Zone, you punk!

283
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,400
Five of the dog holes you dug!
Who are you?

284
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,710
Really son of bitch?

285
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,920
Are you a spy? Nasty bastard.

286
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,870
I'm not a spy.

287
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,550
Don't you dare talk back to me, boy!

288
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,590
I'll report to the main office first
Go to the hospital for treatment first.

289
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,660
Actually, I won first prize in the lottery.

290
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,400
I was watching TV in the Home Office.

291
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Number 1, 3, 30, 33
Number 36 and 39.

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,690
The prize money alone is 5.7 billion won.

293
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,630
That lottery was brought to me by the battalion leader in the Jeep.

294
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,520
He didn't give it to me. It came like fate.

295
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,800
The recruits on duty together suddenly had diarrhea, and the ticket flew away.

296
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,750
- Is that gone?
-yeah!

297
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,190
- So?
- Well, so...

298
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,310
So, go back a little, huh?

299
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,060
Let me talk freely, huh?

300
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,440
- The lottery flew to the north.
- Yes, yes

301
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,480
A North Korean soldier named Sergeant Lee Yongho picked it up.

302
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,450
I'm Captain Kang, 437
Put me through to the hospital.

303
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,160
No, no, Chief.

304
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,880
- A few days ago, at the Military Demarcation Line.
- Yes.

305
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,620
I met the North Korean soldier.

306
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,000
But the guy only wants to give me 10%.

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,050
That's a shame! That's mine.

308
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,130
It's yours, so it's not making sense.
Right?

309
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,670
Do you have a helicopter now?
We have a critical patient. We need to get him out of here.

310
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,040
No, we were supposed to meet the North Korean soldier in three days...

311
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,080
Now the hole's blocked up. I can't see him.

312
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,560
The dog holes are blocked up.

313
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,040
It must have been hard?

314
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,040
Can you at least send a truck if the ambulance can't stop?

315
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,210
Look at my eyes.

316
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,790
Yeah?

317
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,360
We're going to the hospital. Hurry up.

318
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,070
No.

319
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,680
- I know I can't do that.
- What?

320
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,760
Look.

321
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,410
I told you it's true.

322
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,780
I won 5.7 billion in the lottery!

323
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,730
Loyalty! TOD observation soldier
Private First Class Kim Man-Cheol!

324
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,460
I need to talk to my leader.

325
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,800
You're just in time.
You use your computer a lot, don't you?

326
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,860
Can you use TOD to detect fake photos?

327
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,560
Computers have nothing to do with TOD.

328
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,590
This guy's good. He faked a photo, huh?

329
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,260
Let's go back. There's another one.

330
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,520
5.7 billion in North Korea?

331
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,770
Sergeant Park.

332
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,300
So you risked your life over the fence?

333
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,180
You're really incredible.

334
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,670
Hey, I'm glad I found it.
It's heaven's help

335
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,760
This secret is carried to the end of the grave.

336
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

337
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,630
In all battles, power analysis is the basic.

338
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,570
If you know your enemy and know us, you'll win every battle.

339
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,730
What kind of guy is that North Korean guy who picked up the lottery?

340
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,250
A bastard.

341
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
Bastard?

342
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,600
Yes.

343
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,410
For the sake of the party and the people.

344
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,610
I thought this money should be spent for the country, of course.

345
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,960
Same.

346
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,720
What have the party and the state done for us?

347
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,500
You're right.

348
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,480
I wholeheartedly agree with Comrade Lee Yong-ho.

349
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,350
Hard parents,

350
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,530
my sister wants to be a singer's dream,

351
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,290
I will achieve in the end.

352
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,820
I have to change my dad's dentures first.

353
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,070
Very steel alloy
Swiss dentures.

354
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,950
Change them all.

355
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,240
Chol Jin superior soldier comrade.

356
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,350
This heart must not change.

357
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,790
Whatever it takes to kick that Korean son of a bitch's ass.

358
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,630
Make sure you get back from your mission.

359
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,490
You know I have a daughter, right?

360
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,330
Doesn't have a piano that everyone else have.

361
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,270
I came home one day.

362
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,440
She drew the piano on the drawing paper with colored pencils.

363
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,800
Sola Sola Redo.

364
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,870
Can I give you 10%?

365
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,390
One day my wife is going to

366
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,350
pay my mother's medical bills

367
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,080
I'm going to put mom in a nursing home,

368
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,090
but I don't have the money or the piano.

369
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,100
One day the kid said,

370
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,750
Dad, why don't we have money?

371
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,230
Can I give you 15%?

372
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,680
With generous support and sponsorship for 15% of the shares, there is no better platoon leader.

373
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,710
Sergeant Park Chun-woo.

374
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,830
I'm a man of conscience, huh?
Let's do it well.

375
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,220
Manchul, what number do you like?

376
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,260
Number? Maybe, 7?

377
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,200
- Ok, give you 7%
- 10.

378
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,450
So the number 10, 10.

379
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,190
Come to think of it, isn't that a nice, perfect number?

380
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,350
Ten. Name is Ten. Ten. Ten

381
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,710
10, Ten.

382
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,350
Sergeant Park! Park...

383
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,590
What? Why is this open?

384
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,350
I think this is a supply tube.

385
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,340
The pipes are so old that they are often unclogged.

386
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,490
There is no ice in the demilitarized zone even in winter.

387
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,340
Only the supply officer knows the map of the springs and Wells.

388
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,700
How nice would it be to open up and talk?

389
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,760
On the south side is the Lost Property Act.

390
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,650
I mean, there's all kinds of weird stuff going on.

391
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,660
See, section four of the Lost Property Act.

392
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,140
When picking up something lost by another.

393
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,960
Compensation ranges from 5 percent to 20 percent.

394
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,410
How great would that be?

395
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,090
According to the law, you can claim compensation.

396
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,220
Is that so?

397
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,180
So I'm 80, you're 20.

398
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,540
Get out.

399
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,820
You really don't understand the language.

400
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,440
You'll need an ID to get that.

401
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,820
And even if you hold it, you wouldn't get any prize money!

402
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,100
It is said that the period to collect the bonus is one year.

403
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,430
You think there's nothing we can do?

404
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,870
Search all defectors whose in-laws and relatives have settled in the south.

405
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,750
We can find it, too. We win.

406
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,250
You don't make any sense. Negotiations are broken.

407
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,280
You bas...
Really...

408
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,160
How did it go?

409
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,100
Where are those Korean motherfuckers?

410
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,470
If we search the defectors carefully.

411
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,700
We can find it, too.
Can't we threaten him?

412
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,310
If you read that right.

413
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,370
I wouldn't have anything to say right now if you were sentenced on the spot.

414
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,660
Comrade political instructor.

415
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,900
Put the gun down.

416
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,390
Where do you want to go?

417
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,410
Yoduk political prison camp? Gaechon camp?
Pick one.

418
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,010
That's where people used to sweat and bleed.

419
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,540
The exploiters and the sectarians have come together.

420
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,460
It's like coming back to home. Very warm.

421
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,200
I'll tell you the truth, political instructor.

422
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,290
Not long ago Comrade Li Yongho.

423
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,600
Picked up a lottery ticket blown by the wind from Korea.

424
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,640
What's that?

425
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,840
I hear they give you a lot of money if you win.

426
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,570
- The Korean people's...
- son of...

427
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,130
Political instructor comrade, the 645 won the first prize.

428
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,520
The Korean kid who claimed 645 was his.

429
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,930
We're negotiating a 50-50 split.

430
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,610
How much is the bonus?

431
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,090
The total amount is 5.7 billion won.

432
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,100
How much dollar.

433
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,740
In dollar terms...

434
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,740
6 million.

435
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,650
What? 6 million?

436
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,190
How much money are they gonna give us?

437
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,170
It must be 900,000.

438
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,300
Told us to eat 100,000.

439
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,680
No,10...
I'm really speechless.

440
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,730
Aren't they thieves?

441
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,680
You think the north-south issue is that simple?

442
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,350
They always use brinkmanship.

443
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,980
The negotiations have broken down.
What should we do now?

444
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,570
Negotiations are meant to be made up before fight.

445
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,120
We're gonna have to reconnect.

446
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,030
Does that give us an answer?

447
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,060
Meeting is a precious thing.

448
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,500
How earnestly are we waiting to meet?

449
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,060
The depression of not having an answer is really overwhelming.

450
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,430
I would like to speak to my compatriots in the North who do not sleep at night.

451
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,220
Kiha & The Faces.

452
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,870
Let's meet now.

453
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,690
Uh, warden, there, there..

454
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,760
I've seen it too, punks.

455
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,030
There must be a new number of people.

456
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,690
People?

457
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,680
What's wrong with them?

458
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,290
It looks like Korean consonants.

459
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,230
Korean initial consonants?

460
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,300
Yes.

461
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,540
Korean initial consonants? That's "k" in Korean. "K" in Korean.

462
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,770
Oh, right, right, right.

463
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,370
That, that k, d.

464
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,150
Yes!

465
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,010
- Hey, man, Manchul, you write it down.
- Yes.

466
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,460
"K" and "S".

467
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,580
I, I.

468
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,250
- Is it Chi?
- Right, right, right

469
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,290
Why do you keep rubbing your butt?

470
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,340
If it's "k" and "d", then "military"?

471
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,010
Chief, you're right.

472
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,400
Army, yes, you and I are the same army, army!

473
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,390
What about "K" and "S"?

474
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,210
Military?

475
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,600
Military.

476
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,090
Army, military.
We're getting in, all right?

477
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,110
After then?

478
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,450
Together?

479
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,090
Yeah?

480
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,840
Courtship?

481
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,170
A, Prison?

482
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,620
Like a dog bird?

483
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,300
A joint chest gay?

484
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,260
High-dap chest muscles?

485
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,950
You really have a poor imagination...

486
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,100
Co-parasitic fruit..

487
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,310
Hey, is that imagination?
Lonely death zone.

488
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,460
- Together?
- Wait a minute

489
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,970
Why? What's wrong?

490
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,480
Who's in our GP that can go in and out of the Demilitarized Zone at will?

491
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,360
What, the water supply officer with the key to the gate?

492
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,930
Then they have a supply tube, right?

493
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,410
That's it.

494
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,510
Don't they have to bring water from somewhere in the winter?

495
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,230
- That's right.
- That's right.

496
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,250
Here's the place they were talking about.

497
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,660
Common.

498
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,630
Water supply.

499
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,290
District.

500
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,770
JSA Common Water supply area.

501
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,120
Hey, give me the medicine that the supply officer drew.

502
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,450
Ah? You want me to look through it?

503
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,090
Look with your heart and you'll find it.

504
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,120
Heart?

505
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,350
I'm really going crazy.

506
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,810
Hey, where are you going?

507
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,110
A single stroke between controls.

508
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,760
You're not a chicken head, are you?

509
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,810
Drop the gun.

510
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Drop the gun.

511
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,140
So before we get to the talks,

512
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,060
According to the principles of the UN Command,

513
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,810
Weapons will be collected separately.

514
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,220
Good.

515
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,620
It's like our military academy.

516
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,580
The lost and Found Act is bullshit.

517
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,730
I'm here to sternly correct a thief who went mad after eating it.

518
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,970
It's not 645, it's the lottery.

519
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,090
You have to be clear about that..

520
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,760
Don't use USA language.

521
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,310
This is not Korean land.

522
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,890
Let me ask you a question.

523
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,630
Do you know what the taxes are on the lottery?

524
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,180
Tax?

525
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,790
I knew this would happen.
For a skilled TA.

526
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:58,930
In the future.

527
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,550
The total winnings amount to N5.765772,844 won.

528
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,540
Up to 300 million won, 20 percent of other income tax and 2 percent of N resident tax will total 22 percent.

529
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,420
Over 300 million won, other income tax is 30 percent
and resident tax is 3 percent, or 33 percent.

530
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,110
The actual amount received, excluding income tax and residential tax, is

531
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,400
3,914,959,762 won.

532
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,190
You don't even know that.

533
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,980
What about 80% and what about 90%?

534
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,800
Show us, comrade Choljin.

535
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,200
What is it? Lunch boxed meal?

536
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,930
It's just a strong point that's easy to recognize.

537
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,880
Strong point?

538
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,900
Yanks call them PowerPoint?

539
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,200
Our People's Army is beyond words.

540
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,370
I just need one shot of drawing.

541
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,040
Why bother to talk like that and look good?

542
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,800
We didn't budge an inch in our opinion,

543
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,860
so you know what?

544
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,870
What if we don't take it?

545
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:07,040
Then I have nothing to say.

546
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,910
Get up, everybody.

547
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,610
Here we go again!

548
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,090
Brinkmanship again.

549
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,820
In that case, do you think we'd be scared?

550
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,460
And why do you own the lottery?

551
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,450
You won't get the prize with it anyway.

552
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,980
Do you know where to find the prize money?

553
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,940
Is it not looking at the co-op?

554
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,340
Agricultural cooperatives.

555
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,460
Uncle, we're not a co-op.

556
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,810
The Agricultural Cooperative is at the bank. The bank.

557
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,080
Eight to two? That's a lot of concessions.

558
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,500
Did you learn to eat for free from American wolves?

559
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,580
Do you run the lottery?

560
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,510
This is property issued by the Republic of Korea.

561
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,430
You are illegally occupying our property, do you understand that?

562
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,690
What do you suggest?
Illegal possession?

563
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,230
You're lucky you didn't go to the Azzo coal mine.

564
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,670
Azzo coal mine?

565
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,510
You punk!
Are you done talking?

566
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,370
Yeah, I'm done. Why?
What are you gonna do?

567
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,930
Scoundrels.

568
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,970
I was going to make it good, but it didn't work!

569
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,610
What if I don't do well?
Are you trying to do it or what?

570
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,920
You punks!

571
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,220
We don't need any money!

572
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,590
I'm gonna burn that guy's 645.
I'm gonna burn him up!

573
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,010
- I'm gonna burn it
- Burn it!

574
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,940
Those guys could really burn up.

575
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,500
I feel depressed too.

576
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,650
I've never seen such an ignorant person.

577
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,930
Let's just, let's just do what they say.

578
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,810
Hey, how can you say that?

579
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,690
That's ours. Why is it 10% of ours?

580
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,160
All I have to do is get the lottery back.

581
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,400
Think about it.

582
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,110
We have the ticket. What are they gonna do?

583
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,530
Yeah, that's the right answer.

584
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,720
Mr. Political instructor, are you really gonna burn 645?

585
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,460
So we don't need the money either?

586
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,790
So what do we do?

587
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,860
Are you asking me to bow down to those useless guys?

588
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,700
I should have taken 10%.

589
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,320
Isn't that a lot of money for us?

590
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,160
8 : 2!
We won't budge any more!

591
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,910
Fxxk 8:2.
7:3.

592
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,260
Who take the 7.

593
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,290
Of course you.

594
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,760
Did you say we're 7?

595
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,920
Considering North Korea's difficult economic situation.

596
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,770
We made a decision for the greater good.

597
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,830
Is it true?
Is that a fake account?

598
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,580
So.

599
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,330
Can we at least write up an agreement?

600
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,900
Of course we do.

601
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,050
The 645 agreement.

602
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,170
Clause 1.

603
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,950
The winning sum is Democratic People's Republic of Korea take 7
In proportion to the Republic of Korea take 3.

604
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,470
Clause 2, even in the event of a natural disaster.

605
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,620
Clause 3, if there is a dispute between the two Koreas.

606
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,670
The International Court of Justice of the United Nations
is a court of exclusive jurisdiction.

607
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,700
Clause 4, two copies of the agreement.

608
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,290
The north and the south keep one copy after signing and sealing.

609
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,490
Remember, it's either 7-3 or war.

610
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,770
Just trust me for once for the sake of national prosperity.

611
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,460
Wait.

612
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,430
Just saying.

613
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,740
What happens if you do not pay

614
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,510
after we give 645?

615
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,330
Those sons of bitches.

616
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,740
Is that why we're making a 7-3 offer?

617
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,840
That's what he was thinking.

618
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,670
Put down.

619
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,400
You got to let it go, stupid.

620
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,830
I told you to let it go.

621
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,540
I told you.

622
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,640
If you don't let go on the count of three.

623
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,160
I'm gonna rip your teeth out.

624
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,030
OK.

625
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,830
Do it.

626
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,520
1!

627
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,640
2!

628
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,090
- 3!
- 3!

629
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,910
- Hurry up and find the lottery! Come on!
- Take 645 away! 645!

630
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,080
You sons of bitches!
I'm gonna shoot you!

631
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,430
- Shoot me! Bastard! Shoot!!!!
-Manchul, where are you?

632
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,990
Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!

633
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,520
It's because I know where it is when it'sound.

634
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,890
- Move...
- You out of your mind?

635
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,410
- Chief, where are you?
- Don't look for me, man!

636
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,860
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Come here.

637
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,510
Eyes, eyes, eyes...

638
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,550
- Stupid.
- Stupid.

639
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,460
- Bring it on .
- What are you doing here?

640
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,770
Just turn on the light, but it's dark. Did you see anything?

641
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,650
These unnatural and helpless feelings.

642
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,820
Good.

643
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,420
Here, take a picture.

644
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,260
Good.

645
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,170
A little bit over here.

646
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,340
Good.

647
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,390
Isn't that the South Korean supply officer?

648
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,440
Ah, ah!
What are you doing here?

649
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,940
Didn't we have a blockage in the water line before?

650
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,260
I helped a lot back then.

651
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,960
What's this?

652
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,690
I've heard about what's going on.

653
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,110
Sergeant Park, how much did you pay for it?

654
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,660
I didn't.

655
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,130
Didn't?

656
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,230
Just picked it.

657
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,920
- Hey, this...
- Hey, be quiet!

658
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,620
What? Pick up?

659
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,110
Even your kids pick it up and you are claiming it?

660
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,650
You son of a bitch!

661
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,750
Well, I think...

662
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,920
Because it's something that no one can claim.

663
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,000
It's the Peace lottery.

664
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,720
How about a 50-50 split?

665
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,750
Five to five, we're good.

666
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,750
A clean 50-50 split, huh?

667
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,050
Good!

668
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,110
All right, I got it.

669
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,520
But it's not over yet.

670
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,180
The north gives the South a lottery.

671
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,660
I think the South will get the first prize back.

672
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,960
But we have to transfer the money north again.

673
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,560
But how are we supposed to trust each other?

674
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,810
How about this?

675
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,900
It's like a prisoner swap in a spy movie.

676
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:54,860
The duration is 1 week.

677
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,440
The North pays the lottery and the south gets its money back

678
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,710
Before handing over the change to the North again.

679
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,380
One soldier from the north and one from the south.

680
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,880
That should do.

681
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,640
Who's gonna go?

682
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,000
All right, whoever goes!

683
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,130
In case of emergency.

684
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,230
How do you get in touch?

685
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,410
My waist...

686
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,290
You're alive.

687
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,340
This is an ancient emergency network issued in this common water area since the Korean War.

688
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,840
The cell phone of TA-312 A.K.A. Daughter.

689
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,670
But both North and South Korea.

690
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,240
There should be a phone somewhere in GP.

691
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,610
Manchul, where are you from?

692
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,770
Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

693
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,400
I am also of the old school in Seoul.

694
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,720
Sergeant Park, you're from Gangwon-do?

695
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,120
Gangwon-do is not the same Gangwon-do.

696
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,090
It's completely different from North Korea.

697
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,090
Why don't I take the post?

698
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,050
Manchul is not part of our unit.

699
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,630
He was assigned to the TOD observation corps.

700
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,780
Yeah right.

701
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,950
Just 1 week.

702
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,750
But that's not supposed to work, is it?
How do I get to North Korea?

703
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,640
Let's play rock paper scissors.

704
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,790
Manly, just one round!

705
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,240
No, Sergeant Park.
What kind of rock-paper-scissors...

706
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,410
Hurry up and play rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors.

707
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,840
- Just one round.
- Just one round

708
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,050
Yeah just one round.

709
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,060
- Hurry up!
- Yes.

710
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,920
Rock paper scissors.

711
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,690
Wait a minute. Just once.
What? The third round!

712
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,770
Sergeant Park, what's wrong with you?

713
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,140
- Manchul, I'm sorry.
- It's the last time.

714
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,550
- Where is that? Really?
- Just one round, just one round.

715
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,760
If I lose this time, I'll really go.
Just one more round, huh?

716
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,830
It's really the last round!

717
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,660
Yes, just one round!
I'm really going to go.

718
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,310
Hey, I'm sorry. N-Last, last.

719
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,660
You do it. Rock, paper, scissors.

720
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,170
Yes.
Rock-paper-scissors paper!

721
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,670
Sergeant Park, this is fate.

722
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,270
Punks.

723
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,000
Hey, I didn't do it right!

724
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,390
I'm watching what you guys usually do.

725
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,020
Let the sweat run like a river.

726
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,610
If you roll your eyes like that, does your body flutter?

727
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,190
- Be loyal! Be loyal!
- Impossible.

728
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,410
There was no place to hide from the sight of our fellow security instructors.

729
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,470
Hey, you!

730
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,240
Rack your brains.

731
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,760
It's about to be executed. We should do something about it.

732
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,510
Even though we sleep under the same quilt in the same housekeeping class.

733
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,340
I wonder who is guarding the comrade instructor's lackey.

734
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,740
Where we can deceive fellow security instructors in our posts.

735
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,390
Not a single place.

736
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,310
There is a place.

737
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,110
The only place we can escape the murderous gaze of our instructor.

738
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,060
Do you know what the most recognized ant is?

739
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,610
Labor ants.

740
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,020
A calf has only one life, and producing milk is also a battle.

741
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,420
Milk 100 kilos a day.

742
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,830
Be the best working cow in the Republic, you know?

743
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,770
Comrade Yeon-hee,
When did you come?

744
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,100
Comrade Youngchul! Why are there wild boars?

745
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,890
Lost Amy near the army not long ago.

746
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,710
I saw him crying, so I picked him up.

747
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,480
Does he have to be fed to eat, too?

748
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,100
In the demilitarized zone.

749
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,090
Don't wild boar and red deer make good egg fillings?

750
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,490
Actually, I'm a little upset.

751
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,480
Could something this beautiful eat me?

752
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,110
Just a month, and you can grow a little more

753
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,200
Brother! Brother!

754
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,470
What?

755
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,880
Here.

756
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,310
What are you doing with your head?

757
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,520
Hey, recruit.
Put it up there.

758
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,830
What? I didn't hear you!

759
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,260
I said lift it up!

760
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,130
Don't use your hands! Lift up the rope!
Pulled tight!

761
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,380
I was scared at first.

762
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,070
It was a terrible time. It was a terrible time.

763
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:34,030
Because of the softness...

764
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,700
- Recruit!
- Private Kim Hyunsoo.

765
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,030
Bring me a glass of water.

766
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,950
You made a joke.

767
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,040
But it's not fun, huh?

768
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,810
What's the word used in South Korea at times like this?

769
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,810
That's what I did earlier.

770
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,920
- Gap, Gapbungyo? Gapbungyo.
- Gapbungyo.

771
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,620
It's a sudden chill!

772
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,640
Gapbungyo is all of a sudden, the atmosphere is like the principal!

773
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,060
I'm gonna die comrade!

774
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,690
Again!

775
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,070
Comrade Li Yongho, let's do it again.

776
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,310
What's the point of Moonsong?

777
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,690
I'm sorry I was born liberal arts.

778
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,850
Good.

779
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,810
Next, Honbabian.

780
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,140
Honbabian...

781
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:28,330
Who eats alone?

782
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,770
Good job. What's a Honkono?

783
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,190
Who goes to coin karaoke alone?

784
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,210
Good.

785
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,560
Now.

786
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,490
What's bondalbonjum?

787
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,450
Stir-fry the chrysalis...

788
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,760
Bondalbonjum!

789
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,160
If you ask for a number, I'll give you a number!

790
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,910
I'm gonna die!

791
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,540
That's it, this life is end, this life is end.

792
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,650
Really, really, that's really, really.

793
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:05,760
Masang.

794
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,480
- Heartbreak
- My beloved people all over the country.

795
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,540
Brave men and women of the People's Army, brothers and sisters.

796
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,700
Dear, dear nation,
Dear nation.

797
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,670
If the people's army of the Republic must recite a New Year message.

798
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,130
Memorize it vigorously.

799
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,780
The beloved people of the whole country.

800
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,250
Brave men and women of the People's Army,
brothers and sisters.

801
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,020
Sergeant Park, put your hat on.

802
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,100
It's a good match.

803
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,700
Go as a private first class. What?

804
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,300
Can you believe it?

805
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,240
We're all in this together now.

806
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,130
How can you not drink on a happy day like today?

807
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,450
Comrade Choljin!

808
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,120
Prepared the republic's most delicious rhododendron wine!

809
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,090
I knew this would happen, which is why we've got drinks and food.

810
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,420
I only prepared the most popular items of PX in the Republic of Korea.

811
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,130
Okay, just a little bit more of the heavy flavor.

812
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,890
Tie it up.

813
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,960
DUDUDU.

814
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,330
Now it's important. You watch it.

815
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,110
Turn this end

816
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,810
around!

817
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,840
This is what makes tired soldiers want to eat.

818
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,170
Taste it again.

819
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,970
Give it to me.

820
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,040
Let's have a candid conversation.

821
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,310
It's all here. You know who's got the biggest ball?

822
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,210
This is the bomb shelter.
public water supply area.

823
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,270
Stay.

824
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,690
There is Panmunjom in North Korea and Peace House in the south.

825
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,590
Then here.

826
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,440
This is the back door to peace.

827
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,010
The back door to peace?

828
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:29,470
Is this make sense?

829
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,700
This is the back door to future peace.

830
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,160
Let's have a toast.

831
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:41,520
- Come on, cheers
- Cheers!

832
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:45,960
Good!

833
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,440
- My, my !
- My turn! My! My!

834
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,880
Hey, you just crossed the bridge.

835
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,490
What did you say? The guy up there dumped you.

836
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,990
Why are you so surprised?

837
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,210
Is that how the South Korean president walked through Panmunjom?

838
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,100
Okay, so our aggregate score is 1-0.

839
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,400
- Now switch places.
-Nice.

840
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,650
Ah wait.

841
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,320
Do you really want to change this?
This is North Korea.

842
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,230
Have you been crying all night?
Skip!

843
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,810
Okay, let's skip it.

844
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,780
Go, go.

845
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,460
Ok ! Ok ! Focus!

846
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,260
It's okay.
You're in the brig.

847
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,690
But how old are you?

848
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,200
In North Korean terms, I'm 29.

849
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,850
I'm 32 years old.

850
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,360
It's the big brother. You can speak freely.

851
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,420
Ok? Let's get a cup from my brother.

852
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,500
Yes, brother.

853
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,330
But it seems your birth declaration was a lot late?

854
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,620
I did it in time.

855
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,180
What does Sergeant Park Chun-woo want to do when you become rich?

856
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,640
I'm gonna start a farm. A cow farm.

857
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,430
I graduated from the Department of Animal production.

858
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,620
A dairy farm?

859
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,360
Cows are pregnant for life to be milked.

860
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,090
How inhumane.

861
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,710
So I've decided.

862
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:48,090
Cows need postnatal conditioning, too. I'm gonna start that farm.

863
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,360
What will Corporal Lee Yong-ho do when you become rich?

864
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,830
I have a lot of work to do.

865
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,890
I want to buy a watch for dad.

866
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,220
And my beautiful sister who sings well...

867
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,800
Sister? Do you have a beautiful sister?

868
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,470
Brother!
What are you saying?

869
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,530
South Korean television, the Internet.

870
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,380
What scheming has been done to our republic there?

871
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,440
You're supposed to be watching all day.

872
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,280
It's like me. I use my monitor all day.

873
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,630
Of all the networks and TV shows, do you know girl groups?

874
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,030
No, you didn't know that, did you?

875
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,550
Stop it, comrade Choljin!

876
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:16,940
What are you doing?

877
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,320
Hey, Seungil! Choi Seungil!

878
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,900
You stupid.

879
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,050
You've heard the American Yankee water?

880
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,420
Did you go to a thought struggle?

881
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,520
Comrade Political Instructor.

882
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,580
Hey, Seungil.

883
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,070
Please play it again Yongho.

884
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,000
- What?
- Play it!

885
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,540
I love you.

886
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,070
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'

887
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,290
What are you all doing?Get out of here!

888
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,810
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'

889
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,330
Let's do it together! Let's do it together!

890
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:29,170
Let's overcome the hardships and build a better garden!

891
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,490
With a great general, we'll win!

892
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,550
Because of the nature of GP work,

893
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,240
Once deployed, no one can go outside for three months.

894
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,280
Do you understand?

895
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,560
Yes.

896
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,490
You have to get sick to get out.

897
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,500
I thought a lot about it.

898
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,600
Drink stale milk a year out of date.

899
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,010
Food poisoning?

900
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,890
But the way to get out of cleanly.

901
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,260
Whether it's your right arm or your left arm, only one of your arms is broken.

902
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,580
You can get out.

903
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,180
Pick one that you want.

904
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,340
What would hurt the least?

905
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,170
It's going to hurt.

906
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:23,870
I've already told you about it.

907
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,790
As soon as you get out, you'll be taken to the N.K. Capital Hospital.

908
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,670
You're just gonna get a month's cast, all right?

909
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,750
Loyalty!

910
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,400
- This?
- No, no.

911
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,280
Then, with this?

912
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,790
No, why...

913
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,910
Okay, take it easy.

914
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,870
- This, this...
- A hammer?

915
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,700
Yeah, it's one shot.

916
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,350
Stone. That sounds clean.

917
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,400
Oh.

918
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,430
With small stone?

919
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,250
No, this, this, this.

920
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,730
Tell my mom I love her.

921
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:03,780
OK.

922
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,470
Sorry.

923
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,910
1, 2!

924
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,090
Where are you going to keep the lottery?

925
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,040
I'll keep it in my wallet.

926
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,940
You don't know anything about people.

927
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,050
What if a thief stops us?

928
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,680
So I'm ready.

929
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,850
I was gonna talk back to you.

930
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:32,150
I always thought a zipper would be better.

931
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,670
He was a revolutionary soldier in white with a single shot.

932
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,080
An unbeatable army!

933
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,390
Strength of steel! The vigorous Brawler!

934
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,680
A lightning charge into the enemy's fortress.

935
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,230
One man can ruthlessly defeat hundreds of enemies.

936
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,010
The attacking spirit of a hundred is special defeat.

937
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,310
This time the training.

938
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,990
Put the granite on the lower abdomen, with the big view far value of a hit immediately hit the training.

939
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,110
I hear there's a new assignment this time, right?

940
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,250
Who?

941
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,700
The recruit!

942
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,120
Out.

943
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,900
In an indomitable revolutionary spirit.

944
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,850
Give Dantian a little strength.

945
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,460
Hit rocks with little belly!

946
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,890
The beloved people of the whole country.

947
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,330
Brave officers and men of the People's Army, brothers and compatriots.

948
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:02,200
Today we all work hard and meaningfully.

949
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,860
What they've done this past year to be proud of.

950
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,690
Isn't this a New Year message from our comrade Chairman?

951
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,520
Have you learned all this by heart?

952
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,590
What are you guys still doing? Why don't clap, clap!

953
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,100
Okay, you need to wake up.

954
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:28,670
- Welcome to a hopeful New Year!
- Got it. Wake me up.

955
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,310
What happens when you get hurt?

956
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:38,020
If you get hurt, just put on a big sauce, otherwise you'll get smashed.

957
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,600
Stop it!
Stop it now!

958
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,250
What are you doing?

959
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,450
Comrade political instructor, we are conducting basic military education and training.

960
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,450
The recruit was assigned to the farm!

961
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,000
We don't need a drill!

962
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:03,920
Is that so?

963
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,920
What's this?

964
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:15,680
Hey, recruit.

965
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,430
Private Kim Hyunsoo.

966
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,310
Hey, hey, get out, get out.

967
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,600
I told you I had to do it by today, right?

968
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,320
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

969
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,030
Really...

970
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,950
- Stupid.
- It's just...

971
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,400
New boy, let's go smoke.

972
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,590
Out!

973
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,110
You bring Masang?

974
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,170
Are you hurt.

975
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,860
No.

976
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Really?

977
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,350
Really, for real.

978
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,090
It's okay. Yeah.

979
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,710
Don't think of this life as a failure.
It's all small but certain happiness.

980
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,270
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

981
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,900
You're not part of our unit.

982
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,680
Give me.

983
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,970
Give me.

984
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,310
How can you spit on it?

985
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,460
It's so hard.

986
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,320
Stop it. Just.

987
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,080
That's amazing.

988
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,250
You didn't use shoe polish, but it's glossy.

989
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,200
What's your secret?

990
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,130
What's the secret..

991
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:46,210
In life, there's a guy who doesn't want to waste his shoe polish.

992
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,990
Now, spit it out.

993
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,740
What's wrong with your tone?

994
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,680
Did you sprain your leg?

995
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,990
You must have sprained your leg, it hurts.

996
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:09,420
I don't know anything. I miss my mom every night.

997
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,970
So you're an animal doctor.

998
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:15,060
I heard what Comrade Lee Yongho said about 645.

999
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,490
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, okay.

1000
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,490
What about Korea?

1001
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,800
Don't look down on me.

1002
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,210
Go away! A duck that can't even lay an egg.

1003
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,390
Can't ducks lay eggs?

1004
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,900
I don't know what the problem is. It's not breeding well.

1005
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,160
The farm thrives when eggs are hatched and young are born.

1006
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,830
Looks like I came to the right guy.

1007
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,750
I majored in animal production and mating.

1008
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:45,120
Atmosphere is important when it comes to breeding success.

1009
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,190
Atmosphere?

1010
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,960
You have to respect her personal life.

1011
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:51,790
The partitions and lighting should also be emotional.

1012
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:54,860
It would be better if there was music
love songs and stuff like that.

1013
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,540
There's one of my favorite songs.

1014
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,510
It's that song.

1015
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:11,060
- Live with the moon and stars.
- Live with the moon and stars.

1016
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:18,420
- Paradise of feeling.
- Paradise of feeling.

1017
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:25,360
- You live with me
- You live with me

1018
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:32,750
- This earnest heart
- This earnest heart

1019
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,990
Comrade Yeon-hee.
welcome.

1020
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:47,000
Comrade Youngchul, how have you been?

1021
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:51,050
It's long, but who is this ggonsam?

1022
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:55,050
I'm Choi Jung-nam, a newly assigned farm management soldier.

1023
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:57,130
You two say hello.

1024
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,940
Good night..

1025
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,900
Stop moving! Stop moving!

1026
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,920
It's a mine.
Everybody back off.

1027
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,360
You, you! Don't move!
Don't move, you punk!

1028
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,060
Contact the home squadron! Contact the demining team!

1029
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:06,900
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1030
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,990
Then it'll be late.

1031
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:09,560
Everyone, step aside.

1032
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,500
- This is what we planted.
- No...

1033
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,610
It's a wooden-box mine planted by North Korea.

1034
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,210
- The radius of the kill is 3m.
- Get back off!

1035
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,820
About 5m?

1036
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,730
It explodes when you step on it or open the lid.

1037
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:29,810
Remove the safety pin before opening the lid.

1038
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,210
It was like I'm in a detached situation.

1039
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:35,090
Yeah?

1040
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:39,620
After eating 100 sweet potatoes, I was really depressed.

1041
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,540
Everybody on the ground!

1042
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,550
- Get down!
- Get down!

1043
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,360
Get down!

1044
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:15,850
Get down?

1045
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,470
- Applause!
- Applause!

1046
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,830
It's a miracle, Comrade!

1047
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,450
One night, you're gonna have to pack 100 eggs.

1048
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,750
The duckling lays one egg every 10 minutes.

1049
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:07,550
Rabbit, pig, you're going crazy.

1050
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:11,420
The food problem in our republic has finally been solved!

1051
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,550
Wow, you just showed up?

1052
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,270
It will come at a time of hardship when millions of people starve to death.

1053
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,440
What took you so long to show up?

1054
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,720
Comrade Choi Jeong-nam.

1055
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:33,820
You're a nation's talent that comes out once in a thousand years!

1056
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,760
No.

1057
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,680
I recommend Comrade to the cadre training school at once!

1058
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,650
Battalion commander, Battalion commander comrade!

1059
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:44,650
Comrade Choi Jung Nam is a rookie who just got assigned to the squad.

1060
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,860
- There's still a lot to learn..
- Shut up!

1061
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,030
It's already decided. Send him to a senior training school right now.

1062
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:57,000
What do you mean by going to a school?

1063
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,500
There is a military academy in South Korea, but there is no military academy in North Korea.

1064
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:04,420
If anyone gets a letter of recommendation,

1065
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:07,220
You're chosen to go to a training school for cadres.

1066
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:07,890
When?

1067
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:09,770
You're leaving the day after you got the letter of recommendation.

1068
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:10,850
Where?

1069
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:13,740
Where else to go? Pyongyang.

1070
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,950
Congratulations. I've never been there before in my life.

1071
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,460
Wake up!

1072
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,340
That's the only car you can drive.

1073
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,800
How's it going?

1074
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,240
I don't know what it is, but I got it all back.

1075
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,320
I got rid of it.

1076
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,620
The repairs will take at least three or four days.

1077
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:47,190
- The...
- Go for broke..

1078
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,560
Well done.

1079
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,120
Let's go. There won't be a miracle, will there?

1080
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,710
Listen to what I'm saying.

1081
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:17,670
That being the case, you crossed the line.

1082
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:21,230
I want to go home.

1083
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,360
Do you know what Pyongyang is?

1084
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,820
Places you can't go if you want to.

1085
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,820
Comrade Chunwoo, take this opportunity to change your fate.

1086
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,210
I want to go home.

1087
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:36,690
Why?

1088
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:39,370
Make the carts and the ducks fly?

1089
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,360
I'm screwed.

1090
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,970
Loyalty!
437 Cheif, Kang Eunpyo!

1091
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,730
Where you can't even get an ant near you...

1092
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:57,930
Where?

1093
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,250
Who do you mean?

1094
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,840
Heroic soldiers who give themselves to remove mines!

1095
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:02,900
Where!

1096
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,710
That, Sergeant Ha...

1097
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,300
Did the G.P. Experience soldier go on duty?

1098
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,460
In the dining room.

1099
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,600
To the dining!

1100
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:18,150
Stand at attention!
About Captain..

1101
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,490
Sit down and eat.

1102
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,880
Is it him?

1103
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,110
Excellent. That's the soldier.

1104
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,660
I have a good hunch.

1105
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,560
Is it you?

1106
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,640
The soldier you removed the mines and saved the lives of your comrades?

1107
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,950
Yeah?

1108
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,290
Department, department, official...

1109
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,160
- Attention.
- Right.

1110
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,740
You really enjoyed your meal.

1111
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,630
Well, is there anything about military life that's inconvenient?

1112
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,380
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1113
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:07,160
Ok, where is your hometown?

1114
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,410
Up there, Ham...

1115
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,980
Ham? Ham?

1116
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,810
Ham? Ham where?

1117
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,350
It's Hamburg.

1118
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:27,100
Hamburg?

1119
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,390
Germany's Son Heung-min SV... Hamburg?

1120
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,060
Yes.

1121
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,820
The model soldier I've been looking for is right here, huh?

1122
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,460
A true soldier who gave up his foreign nationality to fulfill his noble military duty!

1123
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:47,210
Yeah, well, what's your resolution?

1124
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:50,870
He gave up his foreign nationality and tried to become a Korean soldier.

1125
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,750
Tell me!

1126
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:55,980
In German.

1127
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:58,840
German...

1128
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,350
Comrade Lee Yongho, one in a million.

1129
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,320
I wish I didn't have to use this.

1130
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,320
I've memorized everything now.

1131
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,720
You should've seen this more than 100 times.

1132
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,700
I am a Korean.

1133
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,190
Did you understand?

1134
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,390
Yes.

1135
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,110
Translate.

1136
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,860
Give up German citizenship and choose Korean citizenship.

1137
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,140
It's not anything special, right.

1138
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,690
Because you only get one chance to defend your country.

1139
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,690
The most advanced guard task that no one can complete.

1140
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:52,680
I had the confidence that I could do anything.

1141
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,140
If you ask me why, I'm just gonna say this.

1142
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:17,950
I am a proud Korean.

1143
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:32,410
Brother...

1144
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,380
Stand up!

1145
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:45,240
Applause! Applause!

1146
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:53,330
That's right! That's right!

1147
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:55,950
Hey, this is a moving eco-friendly car.

1148
01:16:55,974 --> 01:17:07,974
Upload by adm820@gmail.com

1149
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:31,640
Stop! Stop!

1150
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,360
This is by order of the Legion's political department

1151
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,140
They postponed the transfer of Choi Jung-nam to an executive school.

1152
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,550
Film the revolutionary recipe for increasing food production.

1153
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:54,070
All outposts have priority spread!

1154
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,870
I submitted the plan to the Legion's political department.

1155
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,650
I used a little trickery.

1156
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:03,990
Thanks.

1157
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,980
It's all I can give you.

1158
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,750
Make no mistake, this is all because of me.

1159
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:22,980
Comrade Youngchul told me, you don't have to worry.

1160
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:29,080
Hey, I'm curious. Can I ask you something?

1161
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,520
- Of course.
- Wouldn't it be...

1162
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:34,420
You know that fart guy?

1163
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,850
It's that guy.

1164
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:40,530
Every time I'm on the air, I'm gonna break your mouth.

1165
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,150
When I see a guy that good-looking.

1166
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:44,440
Break his leg.

1167
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,750
You can jump rope with a rubber band on.

1168
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:50,020
Never get too close to this unbeatable bastard.

1169
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,230
Yes.

1170
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:54,490
Yes.

1171
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,870
What many people want to know is this.

1172
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:07,150
That's why mating is so combative.

1173
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,510
Please introduce the special secret of Comrade Choi Jeong-nam.

1174
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:16,510
To increase milk production from cows.

1175
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:18,810
The important thing is to rub it.

1176
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,940
Wipe! Is friction more important than anything else?

1177
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,260
Just pinch the breast of the cow like this.

1178
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:33,040
Use stroking to relieve accumulated chest muscles.

1179
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:38,740
Come on, everybody, look this way. Come on, squeeze like this.

1180
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,550
Hold it like this.

1181
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:46,070
Like this?

1182
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:48,050
- From the top...
- Show me.

1183
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,370
Stop eating.
You're going to become a real pig.

1184
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,670
Pig..

1185
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,960
You're good.
Good, meticulous.

1186
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:39,300
The chickens on our farm laid 645 eggs this morning.

1187
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:42,290
Very good news.

1188
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:45,830
What's the secret to success in this battle?

1189
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:49,070
Love.

1190
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:55,170
It was love.

1191
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,180
Yes, it is love.

1192
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,440
What, love?

1193
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,610
I'm gonna go out.

1194
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,860
Yeonhee, I...

1195
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,380
Lee Yongho?

1196
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:26,890
Seohyeon Station on the Bundang Line.

1197
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:31,510
The moment you get out of the Armed Forces Capital Hospital,
your life-long mission begins.

1198
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,600
Take the subway.

1199
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,770
The subway is the safest.

1200
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,790
And don't make eye contact with anyone.

1201
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,970
Don't ever.

1202
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,430
Get in.

1203
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,770
Guard officer, you wanted to see me?

1204
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:35,240
Hey, Yeonhee, sit.

1205
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,880
I called you because I wanted to talk to you.

1206
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,990
Is there anything inconvenient about the work of the Corps propaganda team?

1207
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:47,170
Let me know

1208
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:50,850
if you do.

1209
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,130
No, I'm happy with it

1210
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,110
What is this?

1211
01:22:57,190 --> 01:23:00,300
This is an oil lotion I bought with dollars not long ago.

1212
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:07,090
It smells so good. I think of Comrade Yeonhee

1213
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:12,680
Oh, and I bought a nice bottle of wine.

1214
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:15,470
It's ok.

1215
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:22,750
And there is no reason to receive such a gift from a comrade security instructor.

1216
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,330
Why do you keep doing this? Didn't you say you were gonna help me?

1217
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:28,560
Don't!

1218
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:35,650
You girl don't understand me?

1219
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:46,170
You seem to watch a lot of movies, guard officer.

1220
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,460
What?

1221
01:23:48,850 --> 01:23:52,430
That's what they do to make people fall in the movies.

1222
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,430
Can women do this?

1223
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:58,130
But movies and reality are different.

1224
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:01,170
At the outpost of the revolution.

1225
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,880
You are so partisan.

1226
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,220
Yeonhee!

1227
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:10,340
Bearing the heavy responsibility of national reunification

1228
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,700
An elite member of the legion Propaganda team!

1229
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:15,650
It hurts.

1230
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,430
Are you gonna make me look like some asshole in heat?

1231
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,320
What age is it now, God damn it.

1232
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,040
What the hell are you doing here?

1233
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:40,620
Yeah, I'm just passing through...

1234
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:43,090
Let's have a cup of coffee. Let's go.

1235
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,380
Yes.

1236
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,140
There are brokers in front of the head office of the Agricultural Cooperative.

1237
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,540
The winner will be subject to a tax deduction of around 30%.

1238
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:54,040
These brokers do it to launder money

1239
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:58,130
After deducting about 20 percent of the funds, they propose cash transaction.

1240
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,670
But they're all liars.

1241
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:03,330
If he gets caught, he might just take the lottery.

1242
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,440
You have to watch out for the brokers.

1243
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,250
If you go to the bank, go to the petition police immediately.

1244
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,810
There's a special elevator that lotto winners can take.

1245
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:20,450
Go to the police and take the elevator.

1246
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:25,070
That's it. That's the end of it.

1247
01:25:27,850 --> 01:25:29,130
Come in.

1248
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,250
Psycho soldier brother.

1249
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,160
- What's up?
- Come.

1250
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,730
- Why are you doing this?
- You have a daughter.

1251
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:41,220
Do you understand the heart of parents?

1252
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:44,310
- Psycho soldier!
- What's wrong?

1253
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:46,750
Ah!

1254
01:25:47,390 --> 01:25:49,440
Psycho soldier?

1255
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,240
What's this?

1256
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,520
Manchul? Why are you running away?

1257
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,000
He hasn't found money yet?

1258
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,220
What are you doing in Seoul?

1259
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:06,840
Money, did you find the money?

1260
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:09,180
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

1261
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,300
You punk!

1262
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,520
Aren't you answering the phone?

1263
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,580
What should I do?

1264
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,900
Let's go have a cup of stick coffee.

1265
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,500
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1266
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,660
Choi Seungil, 645, 500,000.

1267
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:16,120
Lee Yongho, 645. 750,000.

1268
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:25,150
Choi Jung Nam on June 16th.

1269
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,710
16th, no soldiers came in?

1270
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,370
Our Republic's Hero.
Choi Jung-nam, Comrade.

1271
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:46,960
What are you saying? Is there anything uncomfortable?

1272
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,950
No.

1273
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,980
Comrade Choi Jeongnam. Where are you from?

1274
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,510
Ham...

1275
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,150
Ham, where?

1276
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:56,120
It's Hamheung.

1277
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,880
Nice to meet you.

1278
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,730
I'm from Hamheung, too.

1279
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:02,150
I'm also from Hamheung. What part?

1280
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,830
I mean, um...

1281
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,870
I thought you were the hero of the Republic of Korea.

1282
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:12,620
But it turns out.

1283
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,630
A traitor to the nation.

1284
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:19,680
Get in.

1285
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,420
Comrade Yeonhee, come here.

1286
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:29,270
I found something interesting today.

1287
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,590
Comrade Lee Yong-ho said that Comrade Yeon-hee was an enemy?

1288
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:33,860
Yeah.

1289
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:39,190
But our comrade Lee Yongho has not been seen recently.

1290
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,320
Do you know Yeonhee?

1291
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:44,690
Did he happen to cross the Military Demarcation Line?

1292
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:50,140
Running south.

1293
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:52,360
Comrade security instructor.

1294
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:57,570
Who are you?

1295
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:01,830
The hero of the Republic, Choi Jeong-nam, was a ghost from the beginning.

1296
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:03,440
Who are you?

1297
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,100
You bastard!
Who are you!

1298
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:14,920
I am proud

1299
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,860
- Republic of Korea Army Sergeant
- You son of a bitch!

1300
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:21,420
Rebel of the Republic! South Korean reactionary spy!

1301
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:24,040
Your face looks white and clean.

1302
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:26,120
Ever since you started calling the balls.

1303
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,710
- I asked around, you son of a bitch. - Calm down.

1304
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:28,800
Bastard, I...

1305
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,270
I'm gonna kill this bastard today! I'm gonna die, too!

1306
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,500
Comrade Yeonhee, give me that gun.

1307
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:36,220
Give me that gun!

1308
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,650
Let go of this!

1309
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,530
What's going on?

1310
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,900
Comrade political instructor.

1311
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,190
It's here.

1312
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:59,470
We need to revise our plan and head south now!

1313
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:00,670
Comrade political instructor.

1314
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,650
I'll contact the south side. All right.

1315
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,110
Move to the public water supply area now!

1316
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:06,920
How are you going to get here?

1317
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,180
When the guard instructor wakes up, one of them has to die!

1318
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:13,990
Comrade Yeonhee.

1319
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:18,220
I used to be a special instructor!

1320
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:20,750
A special instructor who went all the way to the Middle East.

1321
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:23,710
Don't worry.
Take him

1322
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,070
and go, quickly.

1323
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,190
Oh...

1324
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:34,650
- You have to go, you have to go!
- Hey, wait...

1325
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:45,300
Take it.

1326
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:56,150
The situation is urgent, the identity of Chunwoo comrade was found.

1327
01:30:57,570 --> 01:30:59,310
Wait, wait.

1328
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:01,540
Wait.

1329
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:05,110
The young boar was in a lot of trouble.

1330
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:08,310
Does the boar especially not follow you?

1331
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:12,180
When you look at this handkerchief, you're bound to think of us.

1332
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:17,850
On the way back, please let the boar return to its mother's arms.

1333
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:23,900
Yeah.

1334
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,400
Go easy, Comrade Jeongnam.

1335
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:36,880
Quick go to! Don't get hurt! Go find Mom!

1336
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:39,680
Go. There's no time.

1337
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,590
Yeon-hee, is it ok that I'm going?

1338
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,660
I'm fine. Just go.

1339
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:57,190
Hello, Comrade Kim Kwang-cheol.

1340
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,810
You have two choices.

1341
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:07,360
A chance to enjoy good fortune after receiving a large sum of money.

1342
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:09,110
Another is..

1343
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:13,730
You and I are not getting away with this.

1344
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,860
One of us

1345
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:26,220
is gonna die here.

1346
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:40,680
If you assemble the gun first, you're a dead man.

1347
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:46,440
But you're really out of luck.

1348
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:52,880
I was a member of the 525th Special Operations Group,
part of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff of Neray.

1349
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:59,150
AK47, SR-25.

1350
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:04,350
M9 Beretta, Glock 17.

1351
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,680
I've won every fire I've touched in a while!

1352
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:11,110
Is that so?

1353
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:18,500
But I'm not gonna die under a gun.

1354
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:23,790
38th Aviation Army Regiment under
the Reconnaissance General Bureau of the People's Armed Forces.

1355
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,230
I came from a sniper brigade.

1356
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:32,250
Comrade Kim Kwang Cheol.

1357
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,640
Choose well.

1358
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,350
Quick.

1359
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:03,790
Why are your hands so disobedient?

1360
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,380
Okay, your exit pass to the Capital Hospital of the Founding Army.

1361
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,920
Depart from Sohyeon Station on Bundang Line on 14:00.

1362
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,010
Transfer to Line 3 at Seonneung Station, Line 2.

1363
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:33,180
Transferred from Jongno 3-ga to Line 5 again.

1364
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,890
Arrived at the Nonghyup headquarters at Seodaemun Station.

1365
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:38,140
Good, very good.

1366
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:42,910
By the way, 15:30
Are you suddenly leaving the Nonghyup headquarters?

1367
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:47,610
At 15:48. Buy and eat at Gwanghwamun.

1368
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,390
Buy a lottery ticket at 16:01.

1369
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,290
Eat soondae at Euljiro 3-ga.

1370
01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:02,540
Why do you buy a hot dog
and an Americano at Jonggak Station?

1371
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:06,570
Why do you go to the playground after looking at the bicycle repair shop?

1372
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:11,900
Yeah, 5 minutes ago. Hwangga's kalguksu.

1373
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,790
You got caught.

1374
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,830
Yes, it's a kalguksu restaurant.

1375
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,180
Who?
Mr. Pervert?

1376
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,250
Excuse me, is there a pervert among you?

1377
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:28,680
Mr. Pervert Soldier!

1378
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,990
You got a call. Please answer it.

1379
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:35,560
Come on.

1380
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,880
- Hello, communications security...
- Hey, you punk!

1381
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:47,470
Did you find the money at the bank?

1382
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:50,330
Why are you angry? I got kicked out!

1383
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:51,280
What?

1384
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:59,110
Maybe, lottery?

1385
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:14,650
- Is this the right place?
- Yes, that's right.

1386
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:17,820
Hey, Chunwoo.

1387
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:19,890
- Brother!
- Yeonhee.

1388
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:22,600
- Comrade Yeonhee!
- How did you know this place?

1389
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,910
It's a long story.

1390
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:26,980
You okay?
Are you hurt?

1391
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:30,970
- You okay?
- Yes.

1392
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:34,530
Seungil is late.
What happened?

1393
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:38,090
By the way, did you find the money?

1394
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:40,180
Comrade Manchul is all right to come?

1395
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:41,890
The fool.

1396
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,360
I sent him to 645.

1397
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,360
How dare you do this to my only sister?

1398
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:00,540
You son of a bitch! Say it!

1399
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,400
What trick did you do?
Talk about it!

1400
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,100
What's the matter, brother?

1401
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:05,710
Comrade Lee Yongho! Calm!

1402
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:08,300
I told you it wasn't like that!

1403
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,520
Hyung? Why am I your Brother?

1404
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,170
If you're a year older, you're older than me!
So you call me brother-in-law?

1405
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:14,290
Brother-in-law?

1406
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:17,000
You son of a bitch or an asshole?

1407
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:17,930
Shit!

1408
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:25,090
The client didn't do anything. What are you two doing?

1409
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:29,430
I'm my idea whether you like me or not. I'm not a toy.

1410
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,780
Yeah, well, if you take a closer look, they're all right.

1411
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:34,460
Loosen the collar at once.

1412
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,880
Thank you, Yeonhee.

1413
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:47,080
Shut up!
You didn't do anything right either!

1414
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,140
Yes.

1415
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,870
- Kim Manchul!
- Manchul!

1416
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:55,450
Loyalty!

1417
01:37:57,220 --> 01:37:59,420
TOD Observation Soldier Kim Man-chul.

1418
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:03,290
Mission accomplished, safe and sound.

1419
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:17,700
Hey, how did you find this? I heard you couldn't get to the bank.

1420
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:21,010
Isn't the first prize in this lottery paid out of the account?

1421
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,980
So right from the start, you can cash it in a day.

1422
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:25,690
It's an impossible plan.

1423
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,900
The bonus wasn't actually drawn at the bank.

1424
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,370
The prize money.

1425
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,270
I was there to find him.

1426
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:37,380
Mr. Rich Soldier, yes.

1427
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:46,200
Don't you think the country got too much in taxes?

1428
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:48,350
Yeah, that's crazy.

1429
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,650
The civil servants.

1430
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:54,700
I want to see something.

1431
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:56,740
Yes?

1432
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,900
The thing.

1433
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,210
Not bad.

1434
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:09,320
What you doing?

1435
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,040
She said she wanted to see something.

1436
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,390
Who said anything about wanting to see your stuff?

1437
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:15,560
Things! The real thing! Cha! Why is that?

1438
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,590
Are you out of your mind?

1439
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:17,670
- Hands on pants...
- No. no.

1440
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:21,020
- No, no.
- Are you crazy? People are so fucked up these days.

1441
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:23,010
- No...
- Hey, you pervert.

1442
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:27,950
Enough is enough!
Please.

1443
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:40,570
I put a zak here.

1444
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,350
-Disgusting.
-That psycho Kang Eun-pyo

1445
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:47,780
- Let me.
- Yes.

1446
01:39:48,230 --> 01:39:51,480
Do you know how nervous I get every time I go to the bathroom?

1447
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:55,190
What if it gets wet?

1448
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:59,670
If you lose and the bank doesn't pay you.

1449
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,750
That is not.

1450
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,850
It's not just money.

1451
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:06,340
No, what's the point of giving four days and three nights off?

1452
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,550
I'm coming to Seoul now.

1453
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,970
What should I do when I come to Seoul?

1454
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:14,980
All right! All right!

1455
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,280
No, I'll show you everything.

1456
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,100
No I don't want to.

1457
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,630
- What's going on with this...
- No, I don't look.

1458
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:19,890
- No, close the ...
- This is outrageous.

1459
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:21,980
Does that make sense to you?

1460
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:24,330
Why are you yelling at me?

1461
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:28,220
Aunt Popeye at the South Gate loan shark?

1462
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:30,160
What is Popeye?

1463
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:33,450
Just eat spinach and his eyes roll.

1464
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:36,990
American imperialist with his fists at will.

1465
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,550
Popeye has a terrible name.

1466
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,720
Yeonhee, Yeonhee,Yeonhee.

1467
01:40:49,190 --> 01:40:50,470
Don't move.

1468
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:54,400
Back off!

1469
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:58,860
Comrade security instructor!

1470
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:01,910
It's made in America!

1471
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,070
Four million dollars!

1472
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:10,630
We can share this!

1473
01:41:10,630 --> 01:41:13,790
- Yeah.
- Split it, you and me?

1474
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,360
Why?

1475
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,350
- Brother.
- Comrade security instructor!

1476
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,120
This is 645 of peace.

1477
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:28,460
It's a sign from heaven that North and South Korea
can share in peace and harmony.

1478
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:30,300
Hello, Peace?

1479
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:34,990
Are you still in a romantic mood?

1480
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,790
What peace? Do you want to be beaten half to death?

1481
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:39,580
One of two has to die!

1482
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,240
Real peace came.

1483
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:43,980
OK!

1484
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,680
Stupid.

1485
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:52,200
You think I don't know?

1486
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:56,860
I know it all.

1487
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:04,280
What are you doing?

1488
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:06,990
That's our money. Put it down.

1489
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,220
Stay!

1490
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:12,360
What are you guys doing? Do something!

1491
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,310
Okay, I'll kill you.

1492
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:18,170
I'll kill you in one go.

1493
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:21,090
Soldiers of the North and South, goodbye.

1494
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:39,860
What's that?

1495
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:15,730
Hey, you fucking boar! Stop!

1496
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:18,820
Stop! Hey, boar!

1497
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:21,460
Comrade Choljin, follow quickly!

1498
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,880
Come here! Don't even eat that!

1499
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:27,800
Hey, you boar!

1500
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:34,150
My money!

1501
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:37,810
Don't shoot me! It's me!

1502
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:39,070
How's it going?

1503
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:40,510
The mine exploded.

1504
01:43:40,670 --> 01:43:45,000
Comrade Guard instructor flew into the sky.

1505
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:46,700
And the money?

1506
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,430
The boar took it all.

1507
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:51,850
It's all over.

1508
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:54,590
Fxxk...

1509
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,280
Brother.

1510
01:44:01,410 --> 01:44:02,790
It's all over.

1511
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:06,170
He's 645.

1512
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:09,410
It was ridiculous from the start.

1513
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:14,210
Let's go back.

1514
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:16,810
What the hell have we been doing?

1515
01:44:16,870 --> 01:44:18,530
Wait! Wait!

1516
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,590
Hey what you doing now?

1517
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:28,380
No, Sergeant Park! It's not like that. It's not like that.

1518
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,900
- You son of a bitch.
- Get your hands off me, Man-chul! Get your hands off me!

1519
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:32,070
Yes, I want it down! I want it off!

1520
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:33,110
Take it out! Take it out!

1521
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:34,820
Done!

1522
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,070
Huh? Why is that coming out there?

1523
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,510
Mister, this, this, this.

1524
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:39,810
Right, right.

1525
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:42,350
Here?

1526
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,910
- What's this?
- Can you...

1527
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:47,100
Right, right.

1528
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,830
Manchul...

1529
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,460
Manchul!

1530
01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:55,350
This, this.

1531
01:44:57,940 --> 01:45:01,040
I didn't put anything in bag.

1532
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,020
I brought another $400,000 with me.

1533
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:05,720
Manchul!

1534
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:07,250
Manchul!

1535
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:11,090
So this is reversed.

1536
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,860
There's a twist!

1537
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:13,960
Yes, yes.

1538
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:17,260
Kim Man-chul is on a reward vacation right now!

1539
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:18,520
Thanks.

1540
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:23,990
Yeonhee.

1541
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:26,810
- Chunwoo!
- One, bucket plant, stone three, raccoon.

1542
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:29,350
- Squid, beef soup, Turkey, octopus
- How much?

1543
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:35,760
Here's $400,000.

1544
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,610
I was kind of... running over here.

1545
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,990
But if it's $400,000 it's still a lot of money.

1546
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:49,770
Of course. $400,000.

1547
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:52,130
So if you split it in half, that's $200,000.

1548
01:45:53,490 --> 01:45:55,110
About 200 million won.

1549
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:56,610
If it's 200 million to 15 percent.

1550
01:45:56,990 --> 01:45:58,490
30 million won?

1551
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:03,980
I can pay the piano and pay my mother's medical bills.

1552
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:09,600
But for that money you could buy100 false teeth made in Switzerland.

1553
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:13,620
Are you gonna let me in, too?

1554
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:17,000
Of course you do.

1555
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:22,630
Yeonhee.

1556
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:35,480
Don't forget my account number.

1557
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,830
All right, I'll text you.

1558
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:46,270
Comrade Chunwoo, good job these days. Goodbye.

1559
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,550
Will we see each other again?

1560
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,670
What are we gonna do when we meet again?

1561
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:54,460
We can see each other when we're unified, right?

1562
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:57,830
Right.

1563
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:01,700
Let's all be united and pray.

1564
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:04,090
Unification is nothing.

1565
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:08,390
All you can see when you want to is unity.

1566
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:31,520
Yeonhee.

1567
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,760
Now it's time to leave.

1568
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,710
Be safe.

1569
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:46,650
Everything you do goes well, and make a lot of money.

1570
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:49,310
Please grant your wish.

1571
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:51,670
Make sure you open a farm.

1572
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:54,870
There must be glory in all things.

1573
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:58,450
I hope Yeon-hee can become a successful singer.

1574
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:02,420
You must come to Pyongyang to eat cold noodles.

1575
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:08,400
Don't get sick. Don't get sick.

1576
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:19,190
Well, then go find yourself a good date.

1577
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,720
And you.

1578
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:47,630
Go!

1579
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:48,700
Go!

1580
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:12,630
Hello, members of the Korean Armed Forces.

1581
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:16,440
This is the Broadcasting Bureau of the 24th Division of the Korean People's Army.

1582
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:19,740
How's your day?

1583
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:37,850
Turn around and turn right!

1584
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:39,130
- Round and round and  right!
- Turn around and turn right!

1585
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:42,500
Turn around and turn right!
Turn around and turn right!

1586
