00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
សូមរីករាយទស្សនាដោយសេរី

3
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,583
Hello, everybody! Welcome to Kat's Vlog!

4
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,875
Can you guess where we are today?

5
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,750
Right, we're back on the road,

6
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,833
but I can't seem to find the campsite.

7
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,875
Where is it?

8
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,333
I've been looking for hours.

9
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,458
Well, excuse me then.

10
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,000
No.

11
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,583
3 MONTHS AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19.

12
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,166
On March 25, 2020,

13
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,166
the government declared an Emergency
Decree to contain the spread of the virus.

14
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,125
Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha,

15
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:28,125
Prime Minister and Defense Minister,

16
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,416
invoked his special administrative power

17
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
to declare an Emergency Decree

18
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,541
to prevent the outbreak

19
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:43,250
of the new coronavirus, or Covid-19,

20
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:49,583
to be in effect from March 26th, 2020.

21
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,916
Thank you.

22
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,083
Thank you, Mr. Driver.

23
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,708
Look at your costume.

24
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,416
Fancy.

25
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:15,125
And this is the hotel where we'll
spend our next 14 days in quarantine.

26
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,541
It looks pretty beat up from the outside,

27
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,416
but maybe it's better inside,
let's take a look.

28
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,750
Thank you.

29
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,458
Dear guests, I'm Prawit,
the manager of the Srichanpen Hotel.

30
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:10,833
For your own safety and to comply
with the authorities' measures,

31
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,291
our hotel mandates
a strict social distancing rule.

32
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,250
According to the quarantine procedure,

33
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:23,583
once you've checked in,
please remain inside your room.

34
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,791
You're strictly prohibited
from leaving it.

35
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,333
Your social media account, please.

36
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,916
In case we need to contact you.

37
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,541
COVID-19 PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE

38
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,541
CONGENITAL DISEASES - SMOKING HABITS

39
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,125
Hi, take this thermometer.

40
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,208
Check your temperature every morning
and evening, and write it down here.

41
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,166
Our staff will come and collect it.

42
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,500
This is your thermometer.

43
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,583
Check your temperature
every morning and evening

44
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,791
and write it down here.
Our staff will come and collect it.

45
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,708
Miss Tevika,
do you have any congenital diseases?

46
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,625
No.

47
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,875
If there's any problem,
inform us right away.

48
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,541
So we can handle it in time.

49
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,833
Are you done?

50
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,416
Pond.

51
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,833
Clean up every room on every floor.

52
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,875
We're going to take more
quarantine guests.

53
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't possibly do that all by myself.

54
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,583
There's too much work.

55
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,833
-June, recruit more housekeepers.
-Yes, sir?

56
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,333
I put up an ad days ago.

57
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,458
-But no one has applied.
-Why?

58
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,458
We were in the news
for being a Covid cluster site,

59
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,583
it has scared people away.

60
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,708
Right, then give her a hand.

61
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,250
I'll go check the 7th floor.

62
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,291
Come, now.

63
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,125
Shit!

64
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,333
Pond!

65
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,750
-There's some animal here.
-Where?

66
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,541
-Let's push the bed.
-It's right here!

67
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,541
-Help me.
-Okay.

68
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,041
-Shit!
-Centipedes eating a rat?

69
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,250
Disgusting.

70
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,208
They're coming!

71
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,375
Kem, you must be vigilant.

72
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,166
Make sure everyone stays
in their own rooms.

73
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,250
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,458
Wait…

75
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,666
Sir?

76
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,583
What are you doing? Hey! Sir!

77
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,583
Mister, what are you doing?

78
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,958
Come on. Stealing prawns?

79
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,625
You can't do this. It's not--

80
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,083
-No.
-What?

81
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,500
-What are you…?
-My son is allergic to prawns.

82
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,208
I'm so sorry about this.

83
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,708
We'll get you another one.

84
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,166
-Kem, take him back to his room.
-Yes, sir.

85
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,083
Please come with me.

86
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,541
Take him now.

87
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,416
Lena.

88
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,833
Yes?

89
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,375
Can I ask you something?

90
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,833
Sure.

91
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,250
Does your brother
always have a quick temper?

92
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:13,416
Well, he has this
chemical problem in his head.

93
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,166
But it's nothing serious.

94
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,416
Let me show you something.

95
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,875
Leo just competed in
a Taekwondo match in South Korea.

96
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,125
Won a gold medal too.

97
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,750
Let me show you the clip.

98
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,208
Look, he's super-cool!

99
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,958
Not only cool and talented,

100
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,500
my brother is also single.

101
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,666
Just say it and I'll hook you up with him.

102
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,083
Peddling your brother to a stranger, huh.
Go back to your room now.

103
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,208
Okay.

104
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,458
Why do you have to have an operation?

105
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,875
Can't you just take the medicine?

106
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,500
I don't want you to get hurt.

107
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,333
I won't get hurt.

108
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,416
The doctor will make me sleep first.

109
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,208
Will you become strong again?

110
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,000
Of course.

111
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,375
One of the guests
is severely allergic to prawns.

112
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,541
I want an explanation.

113
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,833
I'm really sorry.

114
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,583
I'll check the menu again.

115
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,833
I won't tolerate
a mistake like this again.

116
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,291
Is that clear?

117
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,541
Yes, Mr. Wit.

118
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,375
Is there anything else
I should worry about?

119
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,750
Yes.

120
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,458
After this clip went viral,
the resort was forced to shut down.

121
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,750
Fiew, isn't this pretty disgusting?

122
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,625
I bet they never cleaned this thing up.

123
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,916
Like chewing an eraser.

124
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,416
It looks good,
but it should taste good too.

125
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,958
It's an F.

126
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,416
Hey.

127
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,541
Did you take your medicine?

128
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,416
Is it time already?

129
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,583
So what about the treatment?

130
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,333
Forget it.

131
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,250
I've seen too many doctors.
None made me any better.

132
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,583
-I think--
-Stop it, Fame.

133
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,250
I disagree.

134
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,625
As your brother,

135
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,833
I'm worried.

136
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,666
We only have each other.

137
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,500
-Besides…
-Stop, stop.

138
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:02,791
Enough with the drama.

139
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,000
Have you started editing?

140
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,375
The customer wants it on Monday.

141
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,291
Send me the clip first.

142
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
Right away.

143
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,291
Bye now.

144
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,875
INFIRMARY

145
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,500
Kat, did you see today's
registration file?

146
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh, it's not on your desk?

147
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,333
Yes, Mom. Tonight?

148
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,708
I can't. I'm on shift tonight.

149
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,166
Okay, I'll let you know.

150
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,791
Bye, Mom.

151
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,125
Do you need to be at home?

152
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,958
I can cover your shift, don't worry.

153
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,208
Are you sure?

154
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,583
Thank you.

155
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,583
Boss Sompol, you came all the way here.
What can I do for you, sir?

156
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,750
Sit down.

157
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,500
Oh, okay.

158
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,875
Thank you, sir.

159
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,291
-Wit.
-Yes?

160
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,666
I'll stay here tonight.

161
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,541
Oh… right.

162
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,541
Not a problem, sir.

163
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,791
I'll put you in a suite.

164
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,875
-Good.
-Sure.

165
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,250
-And your friend…
-Oh.

166
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,375
-She’s negative, don't worry.
-Oh, okay.

167
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,833
-And I'll do another test too.
-Right.

168
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,291
It's just a common cold. Are you scared?

169
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:41,458
No! It's just a cold.

170
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,583
Nothing to be scared of.

171
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,666
Just treat the symptoms.

172
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,041
I'm relieved!

173
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,666
After you authorized my hotel
to take quarantine guests.

174
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,250
I breathed so much easier.

175
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,416
You're like a brother to me.

176
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
I do what I can. No problem at all.

177
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,250
I'm so grateful, sir.

178
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,875
-It’s nothing.
-Thank you so much.

179
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,833
Thanks, Kat. See you tomorrow.

180
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,208
See you.

181
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,250
Oh, one more thing.

182
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,291
I think Miss Fame in Room 711

183
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,791
has some kind of serious blood disease.

184
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,833
But she denied it.
Can you take note of it?

185
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,000
Sure.

186
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,875
-Mr. Wit!
-Woah…

187
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,958
-We have a problem.
-What is it, Pond?

188
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,791
I saw…

189
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,583
What?

190
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,291
-You saw what?
-Hi, Mr. Wit.

191
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,750
-So?
-Nothing.

192
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,791
What?

193
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,125
What's wrong with her?

194
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,750
And who are you?

195
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,875
Take off the mask.

196
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm Kat.
I've just started working here with May.

197
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,333
Kat?

198
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,791
Since you're here,
can you get me some pills?

199
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,833
What pills?

200
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,541
Stress… relief.

201
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,666
If you can't find them, just ask May.

202
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,458
May's just left.
Her mother needed her at home.

203
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,875
Great.

204
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,291
But I'll take care of it.

205
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,125
I know what you want.

206
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,291
Guys, there are several genuses
of centipedes.

207
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,458
Each of them has a varying number of legs

208
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,375
from dozens to hundreds.

209
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,875
Their body segments grow longer

210
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,958
after each molting.

211
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:04,833
The largest centipede ever recorded

212
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,458
is this big guy called…

213
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,333
a "Tabongplum."

214
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,458
Ancient legend has it that

215
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,125
Tabongplums survived
by possessing a human body

216
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,583
and sucking its blood dry.

217
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,833
Then it would discard the old body

218
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,625
and seek a new one to possess,

219
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,000
and so on,

220
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,583
to extend their body segments
and grow more legs.

221
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,333
What's going on here?!

222
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,750
She's going crazy.

223
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,916
Is she possessed or what?

224
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,583
So scary.

225
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,000
I can't stay here.

226
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,166
Shit!

227
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,166
Shit!

228
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,375
Leo, the tap water
looks like blood, so gross.

229
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,583
Not a corpse in the water tank, I hope.

230
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, same here.

231
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,875
I'll call them.

232
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,500
You're not allowed to leave the room.

233
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:37,208
Look who's talking.

234
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,791
Sick of the four walls?

235
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,583
I suppose.

236
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,875
Hey, wait!

237
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,958
Hey, my lighter!

238
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey!

239
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,791
Hey!

240
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,458
Hey!

241
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,041
What are you doing here?

242
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,750
Okay, let's take a look.

243
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:56,833
Where is it?

244
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:00,958
Where's the body?

245
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Your dead body, where is it?

246
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:08,083
But I did see a corpse here.

247
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,125
That's impossible.

248
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,875
But we both really saw it.

249
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,791
-Let's call the cops.
-Whoa, wait a minute.

250
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,458
You've got no evidence, nothing.

251
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,291
And if there really is a corpse,

252
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:24,625
you are the suspects.

253
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,000
And if the hotel's reputation is ruined,
I'll sue both of you…

254
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,833
What now?

255
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,875
What the hell is going on?

256
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,750
Kem, go check on it.

257
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,375
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

258
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,041
I have a tolerance to poisonous animals.

259
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,166
The figures today have risen…

260
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,000
-More fatalities every day.
-400 deaths.

261
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,708
They said we'd be drowning in vaccines.

262
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,583
I haven't had even one shot.

263
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,541
How about you?

264
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:54,625
I have.

265
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,958
How lucky.

266
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,375
I'm a nurse.

267
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,583
We're a high-risk group.

268
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:04,666
So are taxi drivers.

269
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,750
Aren't our lives worth saving?

270
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,750
Damn, what does he want?

271
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,333
Hello, May speaking.

272
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,041
What do you take my hotel for?

273
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,125
You are a department head!

274
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,041
And you switched
your shift with a trainee?

275
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,791
Is that acceptable?

276
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,208
For what you did tonight,

277
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,708
let me tell you,

278
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:40,666
I can fire you right now.

279
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:44,208
Please don't do that.

280
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:48,000
I promise it won't happen again.

281
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,541
Please give me a chance.

282
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,583
Maybe…

283
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,625
I will give you a chance.

284
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,416
But it depends…

285
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:11,250
on how obedient you are.

286
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,041
Kat.

287
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,583
Where were you?

288
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,041
The boss just lashed out at me big time.

289
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,875
Kat, wait!

290
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:56,916
Hey, Leo.

291
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,333
I heard something going on outside.

292
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,875
What happened?

293
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,666
It's nothing.

294
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,291
How's Dad?

295
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:06,708
How would I know?

296
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,083
I'll ask him then.

297
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:11,416
But Leo,
when will you stop being mad at him?

298
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
-You know Dad…
-Lena.

299
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,750
I told you we won't discuss this again.

300
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,750
Why do you always think for me?

301
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,875
Just like Dad, right?

302
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,583
He made decisions
for all of us without asking.

303
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,416
You are so unreasonable.

304
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,708
I'll hang up now.

305
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,041
Mom.

306
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,708
Mom.

307
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,791
Wake up and talk to me.

308
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,625
Mom.

309
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,375
Don't you miss me, Mom?

310
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,208
Hey!

311
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,708
You okay?

312
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:37,333
Help!

313
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,083
Hey!

314
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,458
What's going on in there?

315
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,958
So what you're trying to say is

316
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,208
someone attacked you

317
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,375
and jumped out of the window
from the 7th floor.

318
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,875
Do you think your joke is funny?

319
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,583
We're not joking.

320
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:06,500
Didn't you see my room?

321
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,250
And look at his face!

322
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:11,458
Miss Fame. You're a YouTuber, aren't you?

323
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,583
Maybe you're creating
a situation to use in your video.

324
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,750
Right, maybe you
got paid to discredit my hotel.

325
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,708
Nonsense. We can sue you for libel.

326
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,375
But do you have any evidence
that something happened?

327
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,541
And who will pay for the damage?

328
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,708
Let's check the CCTV images.

329
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:45,250
Sir, the system isn't working.

330
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:49,416
We need a technician,
but they already left.

331
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,333
We have to wait until tomorrow.

332
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:56,208
Exactly what I expected.

333
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,958
I came out to smoke.

334
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,625
Your stupid cameras didn't even flag me.

335
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,166
I want to move my family to another hotel.

336
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,625
Please arrange it for us.

337
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,083
Take it easy. We--

338
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,416
Do it now!

339
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:16,000
My family and I want to move out now.

340
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,791
Okay, but…

341
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:26,000
it has to be tomorrow… by protocol.

342
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,333
I'm okay, go look after her.

343
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,750
Right.

344
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:49,083
I'm fine.

345
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:53,416
You should be very careful.

346
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,500
Your condition can be fatal

347
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,666
if you are injured.

348
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,375
How do you know about her condition?

349
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,541
I saw her medicine labels.

350
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,291
I used to take care of a patient

351
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,250
who had the same illness.

352
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:11,583
Don't worry. I'll live.

353
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,791
There's still a lot more I want to expose.

354
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,208
Thank you.

355
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,583
Fiew, so what happened exactly?

356
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:32,791
They said
there was a corpse but it vanished.

357
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,958
Then some kind of monster came out.

358
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,875
Scared?

359
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:38,916
Nope.

360
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,208
Your room's a mess,
you can't sleep in there.

361
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,750
Fame, come with me.

362
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,125
Are you hurt?

363
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,000
Lena.

364
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:19,875
Tell me what happened.

365
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,708
Fame's brother
said there was a corpse but it vanished.

366
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,333
And there's a monster too. Really?

367
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,083
I told you, it's nothing.

368
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:31,000
Come on, why can't you tell me?

369
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,458
Because I'm not sure what happened.

370
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,208
Go to sleep. Bye.

371
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,416
Wait!

372
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,666
Damn it.

373
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:03,375
DAD, CAN I GO SLEEP IN YOUR ROOM?

374
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:06,833
WHY?

375
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,541
I'M COMING OVER NOW

376
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,125
This way, Miss May.

377
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:15,416
It came it here, be careful.

378
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,750
Is it here?

379
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:47,500
IS LENA IN YOUR ROOM?

380
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,875
NO, WHY?

381
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:54,333
SHE SAID SHE WAS SCARED
AND WANTED TO COME TO MY ROOM

382
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:58,166
BUT SHE HASN'T SHOWN UP

383
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,791
Hey, stay in your room!

384
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,791
Lena.

385
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,625
Lena.

386
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,625
My sister's disappeared.

387
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,041
Have you seen her?

388
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,250
No, I haven't seen anyone.

389
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:27,666
-Open the door!
-What the hell?

390
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,250
Okay, coming.

391
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,333
-What is it?
-Is Lena here?

392
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,958
No.

393
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,000
-Why?
-She's disappeared.

394
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,041
-Not in the room?
-No.

395
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,458
Lena!

396
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,875
Lena!

397
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,666
Be careful, Fame.

398
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,791
Lena!

399
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,375
Lena!

400
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,083
-Found her?
-No.

401
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,708
-Can't find her.
-Let’s check the basement.

402
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:00,916
Okay.

403
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,250
-Lena.
-Lena!

404
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,666
Lena!

405
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,583
Lena!

406
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,875
Lena!

407
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:12,708
Le--

408
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,958
What the fuck?!

409
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,625
Is that your sister?

410
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:53,416
Why didn't you take care of her?

411
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,541
-Why did you let her wander out?
-You.

412
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,625
Huh?

413
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,458
-Why did you let her out of her room?
-Hey!

414
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,375
Hey!

415
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,291
-Why did you tell her?
-What are you talking about?

416
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,583
-Hey!
-Why the fuck did you tell her?

417
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:14,125
-I didn't do anything!
-Why did you tell her?

418
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,541
Hey!

419
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,333
Stop!

420
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,083
Hey!

421
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:27,291
Hey!

422
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,500
That's enough!

423
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,041
Stop blaming others!

424
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,583
Isn't this bad enough?

425
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Fighting won't help.

426
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,458
-What’s wrong with you?
-Pull yourself together!

427
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,458
What's going on here?

428
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,333
You all right?

429
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,625
Leo.

430
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,208
Fuck! What is this shit?

431
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,666
Whose body is this?

432
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,583
What should we do, Mr. Wit?

433
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,750
Let me think…

434
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,333
I'll talk to the cops myself.

435
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,500
Don't tell anyone about this.

436
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,500
Someone died and you try to cover it up?

437
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,583
You still have no
idea who the killer might be,

438
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:59,083
and you expect us
to spend the night here, huh?

439
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,625
This is my hotel.

440
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,708
I'll handle it the way I want.

441
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:06,666
Stay the fuck out of it.

442
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,833
Fine.

443
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:09,625
Then handle the social media mob yourself.

444
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,291
Wait!

445
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,541
Okay, I got it.

446
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,958
Well…

447
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,166
I'll move you to another hotel.

448
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,083
Okay? Happy now?

449
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,000
Close that thing.

450
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,375
Lena.

451
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,083
Say something.

452
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:50,083
Or just make a sound.

453
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,541
Lena.

454
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:56,208
Lena.

455
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,041
What's wrong with her?

456
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,958
Physically, nothing's wrong with her.

457
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:08,291
But it looks like she has PTSD.

458
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,583
She must've experienced something horrible

459
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:12,541
or extremely traumatic.

460
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,125
Her nerves are still in shock.

461
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,125
-May.
-Yes?

462
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:24,708
-The manager's calling an urgent meeting.
-Okay.

463
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,375
Excuse me.

464
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,458
-Yes.
-Yes.

465
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:46,500
I have something to tell you.

466
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:50,958
Something to tell me?

467
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:22,125
It may be hiding inside one of the guests.

468
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,375
The monster.

469
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,708
This place is not safe.

470
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:35,291
Do not trust anyone except our own family.

471
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,708
I will find a way out of here.

472
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:48,041
Don't go anywhere. I will come back.

473
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,125
I am

474
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:02,291
so happy

475
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:07,333
that you are talking to me again.

476
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,500
Leo, be careful.

477
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,875
I will.

478
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,250
Dear guests,

479
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:08,666
we have an emergency situation.

480
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,750
A dead body
has been discovered in the hotel.

481
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,958
I've already contacted the police.

482
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:22,333
They suspect that
the murderer is still inside the hotel.

483
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,291
Therefore, you must remain in your rooms.

484
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,625
Do not leave your room, not for a second.

485
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:33,125
And one more thing,

486
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,958
please hand in your cell phones

487
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,666
so we can give them
to the police as evidence.

488
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:39,833
Thank you.

489
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,000
Yes, Mr. Wit.

490
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:03,750
I'm on my way.

491
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:19,166
Mr. Leo, I've been knocking.

492
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:22,416
-What’s the matter?
-Your phone, please.

493
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,416
The manager wants it for the police.

494
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,666
Thank you. Now go back to your room.

495
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,833
-Okay.
-Excuse me then.

496
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,750
Lock all doors and exits.

497
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,500
Don't let anyone out of the hotel.

498
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,875
Yes, sir.

499
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:42,916
Yes?

500
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,833
Hey, what's going on?

501
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,416
Who died?

502
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:50,041
We don't know yet. What we know is…

503
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:51,916
it's a murder.

504
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,583
What? A fucking murder?

505
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:56,333
Shit! I'm out of here!

506
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:57,875
Make sure my name never comes up.

507
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:00,416
The reporters will eat me alive.

508
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,291
Selfish prick.

509
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,583
Hurry up.

510
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:29,666
Hey, get me out of here.

511
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,750
Shit!

512
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,291
Hey!

513
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:54,916
Hey!

514
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,375
Hey!

515
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,916
Gotcha!

516
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:33,875
-Fiew, we have to run.
-Yeah, go!

517
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,250
Your medicine.

518
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,375
Thank you.

519
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,166
Centipedes!

520
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,208
Run!

521
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:15,125
Fiew!

522
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,083
Fiew!

523
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Fiew!

524
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,791
See you in the lobby.

525
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,041
Come!

526
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:38,166
INFIRMARY

527
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,291
Lena.

528
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,208
Lena.

529
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,708
Lena.

530
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,291
Le--

531
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:55,708
Leo.

532
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:57,625
Lena. Where's Dad?

533
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,791
He's looking for you.

534
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,250
Help!

535
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:46,875
Help.

536
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,833
Let me in.

537
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:51,916
Wait up.

538
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,416
Get out of here!

539
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,416
I'm okay. Let's take the fire exit.

540
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:02,500
Follow me. This way!

541
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,166
Hurry.

542
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,416
What's that?

543
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,083
Leo.

544
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:37,333
Come this way.

545
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:45,875
What do we do now?

546
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,166
Fame.

547
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,125
Ready?

548
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:25,166
Go!

549
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:33,291
-Shit.
-This way!

550
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,958
Have you seen my children?

551
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,916
I don't understand it.

552
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,250
-What?
-My children?

553
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:49,041
Just run! Go!

554
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,958
-Fame!
-Fiew!

555
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,625
-Dad.
-Where’s May?

556
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:20,291
Get over here.

557
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,458
-What the hell?
-You, come here.

558
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,541
Not you. Her.

559
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:35,000
This handsome dickhead is your brother?

560
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,125
-Yes, I'm her brother.
-Good.

561
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,666
Come here, or your brother's dead.

562
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:47,166
I fucking mean it. Come!

563
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,958
-I'm not joking, bitch!
-Fiew!

564
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,958
-Bastard!
-Stay still!

565
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,625
-Don’t move!
-Don’t hurt her!

566
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:58,083
-Hey, I've got her for you!
-Ouch! Hey!

567
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,541
-Come and take her now!
-Let go of me!

568
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,291
-You promise to let me go.
-Fiew!

569
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,666
Don't forget that.

570
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,750
-How come that thing only wants me?
-Shut up!

571
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:07,833
How could I know?

572
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:10,041
-Why don't you ask the fucker yourself?
-Ouch!

573
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,708
Come on. She's all yours.

574
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,333
Let's get it over with. Now!

575
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:18,416
Mr. Wit, let them go.

576
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,833
It's none of your business.

577
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,625
Or I'll expose you.

578
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,791
Useless piece of shit.

579
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:33,166
-You're fired.
-Ouch! Let me go!

580
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,375
Come and take this bitch!

581
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,750
-Let me go!
-I want to get out of here!

582
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:41,291
You're a bunch of troublemakers!

583
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,041
You're driving me crazy!

584
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:46,166
You're nothing but trouble.

585
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,666
Assholes, you're the end of me!

586
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,333
Come on!

587
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,833
I want to get the fuck out of here!

588
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,958
What? What are you looking at?

589
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,458
You can't fool me.

590
00:58:09,208 --> 00:58:12,916
-Shit!
-Fiew!

591
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Shit!

592
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,583
Go!

593
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,625
Run!

594
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:26,750
Lena, come on!

595
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:33,166
Don't shoot. I didn't do it!

596
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,875
How do we know you didn't?

597
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,250
I really didn't.
She was breathing a minute ago!

598
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,750
How do we know you're not that monster?

599
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,583
What monster? What are you talking about?

600
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,208
The monster that caused all this mess.

601
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:48,875
What is it? All I see is
centipedes crawling everywhere.

602
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,041
Not them. It's this monstrous thing…

603
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,041
that can live inside anybody.

604
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,000
If it can live inside anybody,

605
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,791
it could be any one of you.

606
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,083
When I saw it in the laundry room,

607
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:08,208
I heard it cough,
it sounded exactly like Fame.

608
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,208
Wait.

609
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,541
Wit said I'm its target.
So it can't be me.

610
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:14,958
How do we know it's not you?

611
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,208
If it were me,

612
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,458
I'd have shot you all dead
and kidnapped Fame by now.

613
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,333
Maybe it's your father or Lena.

614
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:23,166
They were always sneaking out.

615
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:29,208
I don't think it's any of us.

616
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:31,333
Or we'd all be dead already.

617
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,000
It's not me.

618
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:37,833
Then how do you explain this?

619
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,958
When I got here,
May was already like this.

620
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:42,958
I didn't do anything.

621
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,833
May?

622
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,000
Yes.

623
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,375
But before she died,

624
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,750
she tried to say something.

625
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,625
Someone's name.

626
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:57,458
It's…

627
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,291
Fiew.

628
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:11,416
Run!

629
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,333
Enough.

630
01:02:34,541 --> 01:02:35,958
That's enough.

631
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,291
Stop it.

632
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,958
I don't know why you want this sick body.

633
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:01,875
But if you want it alive, let them go.

634
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,458
Are you in there, Fiew?

635
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:42,416
Are you in there?

636
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,291
Are you?

637
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,375
Fiew, my brother.

638
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,208
Are you in there?

639
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,583
Let me have this body.

640
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:18,750
I'll return it later.

641
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,375
Let me go!

642
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:47,000
Let me go now!

643
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:51,041
Let me go! Asshole!

644
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,791
Let me go!

645
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:23,958
IF I DON'T WAKE UP,
DON'T TRY TO KEEP ME ALIVE

646
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,291
TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS FOR ME

647
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,708
I LOVE YOU AND OUR CHILDREN
WITH ALL MY HEART

648
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,708
When you get out of the hospital,

649
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:34,333
let's go to the beach together.

650
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,750
After the surgery,

651
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,916
your wife's body
is not responding to the treatment.

652
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:48,583
She's now brain-dead.

653
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,000
A moment, please.

654
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,666
I'm afraid of the operation.

655
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,000
Don't be afraid.

656
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,250
Wake up, Mom.

657
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:56,041
Let go of me.

658
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,916
Mom!

659
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,875
Mom!

660
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:31,666
I'm tired.

661
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:34,375
You can't die now.

662
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:36,041
Take your pill.

663
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:46,875
I won't.

664
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,333
Until I see that Fiew is still alive.

665
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,208
You'd better hurry.

666
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,916
My time is running out.

667
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:15,208
Fiew…

668
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:25,708
Fiew…

669
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,708
Dad!

670
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:43,833
Dad!

671
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,125
Dad!

672
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,625
What do you want?

673
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:12,125
I want Fame's blood.

674
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,625
Why her?

675
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,208
Can't it be someone else?

676
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:17,375
No.

677
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,833
Her blood is different.

678
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:25,500
It will let me live for a long time.

679
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,333
Fame.

680
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:13,500
You okay?

681
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:18,916
Here's your pill.

682
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:23,958
Take it.

683
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:27,416
Come on. Take it.

684
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,791
Now swallow.

685
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:32,333
Swallow.

686
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:35,000
Good.

687
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:48,041
Fiew!

688
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,500
Can you get up? Hang in there.

689
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,625
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

690
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,416
Let's go.

691
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,291
Go!

692
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:03,250
IN CASE OF LEAKAGE, TURN OFF THE VALVE

693
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,916
See you in hell.

694
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:08,708
Lena!

695
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,500
Leo!

696
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,208
We have to go now.

697
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:19,708
Let's go this way.

698
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:23,708
Dad!

699
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:28,416
Hurry up.

700
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:36,500
You know where we're going?

701
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:41,333
Ouch!

702
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,750
Fiew!

703
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,541
Fiew!

704
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,000
Welcome to my hotel.

705
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:26,416
A suite…

706
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,708
Leo!

707
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:36,583
-Lena.
-Leo.

708
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:39,125
Leo!

709
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:11,291
ONE YEAR LATER

710
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:13,291
After that night,

711
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:16,041
I'm no longer the sick girl I used to be.

712
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:19,833
Its poison somehow cured my blood disease.

713
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,666
I've survived long enough to see

714
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:26,333
the centipedes crawl their way
to the top of the food chain,

715
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,708
where they used to be.

716
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:18,916
Stop.

717
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,041
Wait.

718
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,583
What's your name?

719
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,750
My name's Jae-gun.

720
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,041
Did you call for help?

721
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,583
Yes.

722
01:20:34,041 --> 01:20:36,000
Please get me out of here.

723
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:49,250
-A tiger-striped centipede.
-Wow.

724
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:52,625
You can tell at a glance?

725
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:53,791
Just guessing.

726
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,625
Wash it with warm water.

727
01:20:58,708 --> 01:20:59,708
Give me your lighter.

728
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,291
I quit smoking.

729
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:05,083
I have one.

730
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,708
Where did you get this lighter?

731
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,916
From a guy who rescued me.

732
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,625
Are you Fame?

733
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,000
He asked me to return it to you.
