0
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,810
When a lion stomps its feet,

1
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:55,852
the earth and the heavens shake.

2
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:59,602
We pray for the blessing
of all lives to thrive!

3
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,751
Raise the lion!

4
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:05,876
The lion dance

5
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,459
is a splendid Chinese tradition

6
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:12,668
that combines dance, music and
martial arts into one performance.

7
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:14,852
Since ancient times,

8
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:16,709
the lion dance has been popular

9
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,883
and passed down from
generation to generation.

10
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,376
At all grand events, a lion dance
is essential for a fun atmosphere.

11
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,852
For those who are far away from home,

12
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,185
the sight of a dancing lion
raising its head to thundering drums

13
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:33,209
immediately reminds them of home,

14
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:38,251
giving them hope for tomorrow
despite today's hardships.

15
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,019
There are two lion dance styles,
the North and the South.

16
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:47,560
Southern lion dances are expressive.
By jumping, moving, dodging, pouncing,

17
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:49,209
spinning, and leaping,

18
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,668
the performers present the lion

19
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:54,418
as fierce, mighty, and lively.

20
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:56,227
"Picking the Lettuce"

21
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,376
is a Southern lion dance performance.

22
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,043
The two lions compete for a head of lettuce
that connotes wealth building.

23
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:03,644
The one who dances

24
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:07,126
with the best footwork and
body movements wins the contest.

25
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:11,560
There have been many lion dance masters
over the past millennia

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,769
and the legend of Master Wong Fei-hung

27
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,227
is known to every household.

28
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,810
But this story

29
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:20,251
isn't about him.

30
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,834
It is a story about...

31
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:32,793
Daoshan dude yo

32
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:38,501
Why are you wearing
your worn-out flip-flops?

33
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,602
Daoshan dude yo

34
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,602
Gyun. Have your parents come back yet?

35
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:45,519
Why are you still riding that old bike?

36
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:46,852
Gyun, where are you going?

37
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,310
To watch the lion dance show.

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:54,310
You're so full of yourself

39
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,935
Dark clouds shroud the sky

40
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,435
It's going to rain

41
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,810
My mom is waiting for me to have supper

42
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,935
I'm to blame for back then

43
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,144
I was a good-for-nothing,
and always messed around

44
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:14,852
I'm to blame for back then

45
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:19,168
You're so cocky

46
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:28,852
Celebrate the Spring Festival!

47
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,751
Hi, take a look.

48
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,334
Hi, take a look.

49
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:35,186
Mister, have a look.

50
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,376
What is this?

51
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:39,852
Welcome to the Spring Festival

52
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:43,876
Lion Dance Competition of the year.

53
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,168
Look at the lively lion dance teams.

54
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:50,709
They look so cool!

55
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,810
An inspiration to the soul.

56
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:56,168
And a salute to our lives!

57
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,602
What are you doing?

58
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:04,519
What's wrong with you?
Quit trying to squeeze through!

59
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:05,436
Let him be.

60
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,168
He's gone through a lot.

61
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:09,019
His parents are working in Guangzhou,

62
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,352
they've been away from home for years.

63
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,293
No one's taught him any manners.

64
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,977
Wow! This is so cool!

65
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,560
Woo!

66
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,060
This is amazing!

67
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,543
Don't get in my way.

68
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,834
Chad.

69
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:46,227
You've got a melon head already.

70
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,334
You don't need to wear another!

71
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:50,310
I'm just having fun.

72
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,793
Happy New Year.

73
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,959
Happy?

74
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,144
This is a team of lions.

75
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:59,227
Yet you, a puny cat,
dare to get in our way.

76
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,626
Such a jinx.

77
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,509
How are we supposed to
have a happy new year?

78
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,501
Did you get a red pocket?

79
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,310
My grandpa gave me one.

80
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,834
Give it to me to counter the bad luck.

81
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,727
What a loser.

82
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,584
Thanks for the red pocket.

83
00:05:57,918 --> 00:05:59,209
I can't believe it.

84
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,852
Someone dared to challenge

85
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:03,376
Chen's Village to a
"Lettuce Picking" battle!

86
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:06,043
- Bring me the head.
- Roger that.

87
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:29,709
Go, Red Lion!

88
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:32,168
I thought you were gone.

89
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:35,501
Go, Black Lion!

90
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:40,209
Yeah!

91
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,126
That's amazing!

92
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:47,251
Who the hell are you?

93
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:48,876
Stop her!

94
00:07:57,584 --> 00:07:59,334
Over here.

95
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:01,334
Get on.

96
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,043
Stop.

97
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,935
- Go that way to outflank them.
- Outta my way!

98
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,359
- They're making a turn.
- That way!

99
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,751
Watch out!

100
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,751
Well, we're running away
from people, aren't we?

101
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,376
Then why did you take me to the hilltop

102
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:20,769
where they can easily
spot us by looking up?

103
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,543
What now? Let's keep running.

104
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,293
That's fine.

105
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,084
We shook them off a while ago.

106
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:40,376
What's your name?

107
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:41,459
Me?

108
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,168
My name is Gyun.

109
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,209
Mine too.

110
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,834
How do you spell that?

111
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,435
G-Y-U-N. Often used in girl names.

112
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,668
No kidding. Mine too.

113
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:56,293
What's up with you?

114
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:58,043
Why do you have a girl's name?

115
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,334
I got ill easily when I was young.

116
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,876
My parents worried about me.

117
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:04,751
They believed that a girl's name
would bring me good luck.

118
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,334
I guess now that we're "friends in need,"

119
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,751
you can keep it.

120
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:19,834
Really?

121
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,084
But I can't do the lion dance.

122
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:24,126
Stand up.

123
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,959
Put it on.

124
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:39,751
Close your eyes.

125
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:47,168
Do you hear

126
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:49,043
a roar in your heart?

127
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,584
What roar?

128
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,376
It's roaring at you,

129
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,668
"Don't be a puny cat
that always gets bullied."

130
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,751
"Be a fierce lion."

131
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,751
Sixth Lion Dance Games.

132
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,459
Promotional Ambassador.

133
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,709
Champion.

134
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:30,834
Do you...

135
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:32,626
Do you really think I can do it?

136
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:44,709
Definitely.

137
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,834
Cotton tree flowers are
known as Hero Flowers.

138
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,376
You're the man chosen by a Hero Flower.

139
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:53,918
Hero Flowers.

140
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,251
Here, have some more.

141
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,626
You too, Grandpa.

142
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:27,751
Make a call to your parents later.

143
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,251
Gyun.

144
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:31,584
How is it going?
Is everything okay back home?

145
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,918
Yep, don't worry.

146
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:35,560
How are you and Mom?

147
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,918
We're fine, too. Don't worry.

148
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,584
We have everything here in Guangzhou.

149
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,376
It's New Year's Eve.

150
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,501
We have extra dishes
for our working dinner.

151
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:46,477
We're going to have a big feast!

152
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,543
Gyun.

153
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:49,310
Have a happy new year with your grandpa.

154
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:50,751
Eat well.

155
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:52,001
Next year,

156
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:54,501
we promise we'll come home, okay?

157
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:55,983
We'll watch the lion dance together.

158
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,519
Dad, Mom,

159
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,019
I'm not a child anymore.

160
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,769
I'm 18 now. You know what that means?

161
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,113
Many of my classmates
have already started working outside.

162
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,644
You can come back and
rest at home next year.

163
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:05,959
I'll be the breadwinner.

164
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:09,560
Nonsense. What can you do,
you scrawny little dude?

165
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,376
Focus on your schoolwork.

166
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,793
We'll take on more work since
it's the busy season

167
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,518
and save money for your college tuition.

168
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:16,709
Yes.

169
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:34,668
This way I can see them all.

170
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,876
This year, my wish
didn't come true, either.

171
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:42,834
It's fine. I don't blame you.

172
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,959
If Mom and Dad can't make it,

173
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,168
I'll make another wish.

174
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,019
I'm going to Guangzhou

175
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,959
to surprise them.

176
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,876
Lion Dance Games,

177
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:04,293
I'm coming.

178
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,793
Kat... I want to be a lion dancer.

179
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:18,935
Have you hit your head?

180
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,959
Lion dancer?

181
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:21,168
I'm serious.

182
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:22,602
There's a competition,
but I can't do it by myself.

183
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:23,709
Don't count me in.

184
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:24,770
Besides,

185
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:28,501
the lion head mask isn't
something we can afford.

186
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,584
Wow, where did you steal it from?

187
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:33,668
Let's sell it.

188
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,084
It's not stolen.

189
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,477
Alright, weirdo. What a buzzkill.

190
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:39,543
A girl gave it to me.

191
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:40,918
A girl?

192
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,209
Was she pretty?

193
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:43,810
Very pretty.

194
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,376
Come, come. Have a seat.

195
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:50,876
Tell me all the details.

196
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,418
Here's the thing.

197
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,560
Yesterday at the square,

198
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:54,644
I met the guys from Chen's Village again...

199
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:55,395
No, no, no.

200
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:58,751
Tell me in detail how pretty the girl was.

201
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,001
That's her.

202
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,376
She's alright.

203
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,366
Then why is your nose bleeding?

204
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:15,543
I ate too many bananas.

205
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,834
So if we join the competition,

206
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,168
we can meet girls like her, right?

207
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,459
Yes. Are you coming or not?

208
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,251
Of course I am.

209
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,959
I've always dreamed of
becoming a lion dancer.

210
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,459
Since when?

211
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,209
Just now.

212
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:32,751
We still need a drummer.

213
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,959
Follow me.

214
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,501
Hand-beaten Beef Balls.

215
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,918
Pure Beef.

216
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:41,168
As pure as first love.

217
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:42,751
Doggie.

218
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,896
We're going to form a lion dance team.

219
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:50,668
Leave me alone.

220
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,519
There's a position saved for you.

221
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,376
We want you to be our drummer.

222
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,918
My parents' work in the city
can barely support me.

223
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,751
I need to feed myself.

224
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,352
Doggie. Have you finished yet?

225
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,709
Almost, Boss.

226
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,126
Just go.

227
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:06,876
Don't waste my time at work.

228
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,126
Where are the beef balls?

229
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:14,478
You said lunch is included, didn't you?

230
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:21,584
Is lunch provided

231
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:22,894
during the competition?

232
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:23,918
Yes.

233
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:25,209
Bed and board included!

234
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:27,376
Well...

235
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:28,543
Where's the drum?

236
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:38,227
Attention, please, my dear friends.

237
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:40,644
A chance for fame has arisen.

238
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,394
Our lion dance team is
going to the competition.

239
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,977
A top team like us is bound to win,

240
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,144
but we still need a drum.

241
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:49,810
If you kindly sponsor us with a drum,

242
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,144
we will sew your shop name

243
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:52,810
on our costumes.

244
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,770
So your shop

245
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:56,394
will be advertised on TV for free.

246
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:59,834
It's a real bargain, anyone interested?

247
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,668
Gyun, you pathetic thing.

248
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,352
Like it's not enough to be a loser alone.

249
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:17,126
You actually joined a
team of stray cats and dogs.

250
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,584
Do you really think you three
good-for-nothings can do lion dancing?

251
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:23,543
Hey, notice something fishy?

252
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,602
The egg went bad.

253
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,918
I mean, how do they know that
our names are Kat and Doggie?

254
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,161
What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,126
They came prepared.

256
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,769
Hey, don't start a fight.

257
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:34,810
Don't worry, old man.

258
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,084
Just go back.

259
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,186
He's coming.

260
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,626
What should we do?

261
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,834
Overpower him with your aura.

262
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:49,561
You can't have it.

263
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:53,543
This lion head looks so familiar.

264
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,376
I remember.

265
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,834
I'm not sure who it was,

266
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:03,435
but what happened at
the Lettuce Picking contest

267
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:06,043
and the humiliation it brought to me...

268
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,043
Was it you?

269
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:11,310
How could it possibly be me?

270
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:13,394
Look at me. Look closer.

271
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:16,126
I'm just a loser, alright?

272
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:20,001
That does make sense.

273
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,751
Then it was you.

274
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:25,793
Bro.

275
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,543
I know I'm a big guy,

276
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,501
but I'm still feeling dizzy

277
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,376
from the egg attack.

278
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,435
How would I ever have
the guts to mess with you?

279
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,418
I guess I have no choice

280
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:39,418
but to

281
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:43,418
take it out on this lion head!

282
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:50,935
You can always buy a new one.

283
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:51,959
Nothing to cry about.

284
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,709
Oh, I almost forgot,

285
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:57,852
your poor parents

286
00:18:57,876 --> 00:18:59,501
have worked in the city for years

287
00:18:59,751 --> 00:19:01,084
but never returned.

288
00:19:01,334 --> 00:19:03,435
They must be too ashamed to come home

289
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,001
because they haven't earned enough.

290
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:14,145
Gyun.

291
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,251
Beat him!

292
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:28,293
Let's go home.

293
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:10,685
To be honest,

294
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,459
I envy them so much.

295
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:14,352
Yeah.

296
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:16,334
Their team looks invincible.

297
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,959
Their drum is so big.

298
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,209
It looks so cool when they drum.

299
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:25,435
The sun rises with a weak red light,

300
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,059
soon it will shine over all of the land.

301
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:28,848
The Yellow River springs from underground,

302
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:30,435
eventually it surges with immense force.

303
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:31,727
The dragon soars up from the abyss...

304
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:32,728
Melon head.

305
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:33,876
Like a puny cat.

306
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:35,168
You pervert!

307
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:36,977
You're so stupid.

308
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,918
Fatso.

309
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,459
I can hear

310
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,751
a roar in my heart.

311
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,834
It says,

312
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,310
"Don't be a puny cat
that always gets bullied."

313
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,168
What cat?

314
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:10,001
Actually we could try again.

315
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,769
But we've got nothing.

316
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:13,810
Forget it.

317
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,310
Yeah. Forget it.

318
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,834
Then why are you crying?

319
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:19,435
Come on.

320
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:21,209
We got beaten up just now.

321
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:22,418
Yep.

322
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:24,751
We're no match for them.

323
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,126
Why are you crying?

324
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:29,959
Because I wanna be like them.

325
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,043
I wanna be a fierce lion!

326
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:38,959
Ahhh.

327
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:46,060
Shut up!

328
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:48,126
I have to go to work tomorrow!

329
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:53,685
Is it normal that we have to wait so long
to be their apprentices?

330
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,060
Poet Li Bai once said,

331
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:56,685
"Your sincerest determination
can cut open metal and stone."

332
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:57,709
Have some faith.

333
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,918
Li Bai didn't say that, did he?

334
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:45,418
What do you want?

335
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,001
Want to learn the lion dance?

336
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,334
Yes.

337
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,459
Let's... let's go.

338
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:08,251
I think there's a guy...

339
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:12,043
Please, sir.

340
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,251
Keep going.

341
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:19,626
Here's a map.

342
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:21,918
Go find him.

343
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:29,251
The man lives in seclusion
and is untraceable,

344
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:31,060
but his legend is still being told.

345
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,834
He used to be the pride of all.

346
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:38,584
People called him the
reincarnation of Wong Fei-hung.

347
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,310
Is this really the right way?

348
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:42,978
How about...

349
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:44,834
Ahhh.

350
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:53,543
This map is definitely correct.

351
00:23:55,376 --> 00:24:00,251
Despite all the dangers and difficulties,

352
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:04,293
you must blaze your way through.

353
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:10,102
Pass the trials if you
want to be his apprentice.

354
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:11,543
There's a river.

355
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,019
Okay. Then we wade across it.

356
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:16,363
It's pretty normal to jump through some hoops
when you're looking for a mentors hip.

357
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:23,852
We've had enough.

358
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:24,645
This time, please,

359
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:26,418
you must come with us.

360
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:29,310
This time you won't have any problem.

361
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,793
We don't trust you.

362
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:38,334
He's over there.

363
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,918
Are you kidding me, sir?

364
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,001
This place

365
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,769
is only 20-minute walk from my house.

366
00:24:43,793 --> 00:24:45,102
You should have told us.

367
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:47,626
Why have us travel all
the way out in the wild?

368
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:52,418
It wasn't until I came with you

369
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:55,959
that I slowly realized

370
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:59,376
this isn't Shandong,

371
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:02,043
but Guangdong.

372
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:06,418
How did I get here?

373
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:12,459
How should I go back?

374
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:26,959
There's no way a lion
dance master lives here.

375
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,209
Are you sure he's here?

376
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:30,418
Hey.

377
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:33,626
Can you draw us one last map?

378
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:00,602
It can't be him, can it?

379
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,876
Who wrote this terrible story?

380
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:05,227
Am I still dreaming?

381
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:06,251
Hello?

382
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,293
Want some salted fish?

383
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:12,001
If he can perform a lion dance,

384
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,084
we can play heroes in a film.

385
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:52,810
Even the salted fish got turned around
by his steps.

386
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,727
Does that mean we

387
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,668
can finally turn our lives around, too?

388
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,376
Qiang, have you lost your mind!

389
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:05,810
Our customers are waiting for
your fish delivery, remember?

390
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:06,728
You're not Wong Fei-hung!

391
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,232
And quit trying to do the lion dance!

392
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,501
Pack up!

393
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:11,793
What are you looking at?

394
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,227
Hurry!

395
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:16,668
They've rushed us several times.

396
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,334
Wear the helmet.

397
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:19,810
Don't make me worry about you.

398
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:22,209
The country is rich when
its teenagers are rich.

399
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,918
The country is strong
when its teenagers are strong.

400
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:26,727
The country is independent
when its teenagers are independent.

401
00:27:26,751 --> 00:27:27,751
Follow him.

402
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,418
The country enjoys liberty
when its teenagers enjoy liberty.

403
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:31,918
The country makes progress...

404
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:42,686
Where should we deliver these to?

405
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,543
We'd love to help.

406
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:00,602
What's next?

407
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:01,959
We'd love to help.

408
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:03,959
What do you want?

409
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,459
There's a competition.

410
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:07,584
We want you to teach us lion dancing.

411
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:25,793
Lion dance.

412
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,185
Qiang!

413
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:28,644
Why don't you deliver at midnight?

414
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,810
I won't need fish by then anyway.

415
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,519
A dead fish like you wants to
perform a lion dance?

416
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,209
Sea lion dance, maybe.

417
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,810
You're just too old to talk
about pursuing dreams.

418
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,474
Go home and look at yourself in a mirror.

419
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:39,935
Selling fish fits you!

420
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:42,479
You might as well just settle with it
for the rest of your life!

421
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,626
You all heard him.

422
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,834
I'm just a fish seller.

423
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:51,310
And you don't seem to have the talent
for lion dancing anyway.

424
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:53,293
So get out of my hair.
I've got bills to pay.

425
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,102
It's hot today.

426
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,418
Buy some popsicles for yourselves.

427
00:28:58,543 --> 00:28:59,793
Thank you.

428
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,626
What should we do now?

429
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:09,477
Buy... buy popsicles.

430
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:10,501
Yes.

431
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:20,959
Fool around all day long.

432
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:50,603
Amazing, aren't they?

433
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:52,334
Yeah... yeah...

434
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:54,103
Here.

435
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,918
Use the helmet and
let me see where you're at.

436
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,310
Look over here, guys.

437
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,019
These guys are joining
the Lion Dance Games, too.

438
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:17,334
Take a look at them.

439
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:21,876
What the heck are they doing?

440
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:26,186
Now you know

441
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,626
where you're at, right?

442
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:30,435
What level are we at?

443
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,626
You can break a scale. What do you think?

444
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,626
What about me?

445
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,209
You...

446
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,209
You look like a monkey.

447
00:30:39,543 --> 00:30:40,876
You should do monkey tricks

448
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:42,501
instead of lion dance, huh?

449
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:44,793
What about me?

450
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,501
If I hadn't seen those
innocent eyes of yours,

451
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:49,459
I'd have thought you
just got out of prison.

452
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,334
You look malnourished, like a puny cat.

453
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:53,644
Did this fatso

454
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,626
take all your food?

455
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,793
What does that have to do with me?

456
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,560
I know you don't see much of us.

457
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,376
Duh.

458
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:05,769
Us three

459
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:07,501
are just losers to you.

460
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,584
Nothing but a puny cat, scrawny monkey,

461
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:10,810
and fat pig.

462
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,209
Am I right?

463
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:25,334
But the famous poet Li Bai once said,

464
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:27,418
"All things in their being
are good for something."

465
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:32,668
He also said...

466
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:34,459
"I laugh as I depart to my journey,"

467
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,959
"how can I be a commoner with such talent?"

468
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:42,251
Li Bai...

469
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:43,959
Li Bai also said...

470
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,208
"When it's time to hoist the sails
to cross the sea,

471
00:31:46,501 --> 00:31:48,751
ride the wind and cleave the waves."

472
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:50,352
Alright, alright.

473
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,084
I can tell you're obsessed with Li Bai.

474
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,001
What are you trying to say?

475
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:56,293
What I'm saying is...

476
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:59,584
Did he spew a bunch of lies?

477
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,918
Was he just some liar?

478
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,501
If what Li Bai said wasn't true,

479
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,810
then why do I feel so alive

480
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:09,251
when I say it out loud?

481
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,685
Don't people like us

482
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,668
deserve a chance?

483
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:14,876
For once,

484
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,084
to prove that

485
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,727
we're not born to be the butt of a joke,

486
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:19,935
or to be picked on,

487
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,918
or to be stepped all over!

488
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:58,293
Your physiques aren't good enough.

489
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,126
One more fish for each of you.

490
00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:07,709
Lion dancing is physically demanding.

491
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,435
Thank you, Qiang!

492
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:12,168
No...

493
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:13,543
Thank you, Sifu!

494
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:16,145
Don't thank me.

495
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:17,418
Thank Li Bai.

496
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,751
Why would you thank me?

497
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:34,227
The horns have sounded

498
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:37,376
Let's race back home

499
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:40,644
Chasing the sun along the way

500
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,560
And telling each other our feelings

501
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:46,793
The sun dissipates into the night

502
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,602
Creating an intoxicating
and otherworldly scene

503
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,602
Fold a paper plane

504
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:55,959
And let it fly away with our dreams

505
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,584
Grandpa said you're quite busy lately.

506
00:33:58,834 --> 00:33:59,728
What are you working on?

507
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:01,959
I can't tell you just yet.
It's gonna be a surprise.

508
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,185
Don't let it affect your schoolwork.

509
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:03,936
Got it.

510
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,227
Focus on school.

511
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,918
We'll work hard and bring money home.

512
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:08,668
Be safe, Dad.

513
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,084
Here's the money, sir.

514
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:11,209
Later.

515
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:13,584
Forget about the hardships and obstacles

516
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:18,019
We strive hard towards
the direction of our goal

517
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:22,334
Our dreams and aspirations

518
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:31,418
Fly, fly away

519
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:37,227
Spread our wings and fly towards our dreams

520
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,102
Our dreams and aspirations

521
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:42,959
Are always on our minds

522
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:45,019
The journey might be long

523
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:49,084
But we'll never give up

524
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:04,352
Every time we trip and fall

525
00:35:04,376 --> 00:35:07,644
We might hide in the corner alone

526
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:10,560
But what still shines in our hearts

527
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:13,376
Is the light of our initial intentions

528
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:14,769
Rainbows appear after storms

529
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:15,728
Sifu,

530
00:35:15,752 --> 00:35:16,935
is there a secret ultimate lion dance move?

531
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,168
Sit properly!

532
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:24,060
We learn from every defeat

533
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:28,584
Then pick up our dreams and fly once more

534
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:33,769
This jerk slacked off again.

535
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:36,334
There's salted fish everywhere.

536
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:43,060
If your passion remains, then fly with me

537
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:49,185
Forget all the pain and loss

538
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:55,543
The world can change
but not our determination

539
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,043
I'm a lion dance genius. I'm telling you!

540
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:00,293
The pickled veggies go well with rice.

541
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:04,168
Sifu.

542
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,102
You should be our leader

543
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:07,852
when we go to the competition.

544
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,793
So we can feel more confident.

545
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:13,269
What competition?

546
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:14,228
What leader?

547
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:15,394
What are you talking about?

548
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,293
I've got mouths to feed!

549
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,352
I'm only coaching you guys

550
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:20,560
because you deliver fish for free.

551
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:21,959
Don't even think about it.

552
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:32,126
That's just great...

553
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:35,019
I bet she's looking for
stuff to beat me with!

554
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:35,852
What were you thinking?

555
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:36,770
Are you stupid?

556
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,227
Why would you bring that up
in front of Mrs. Qiang?

557
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:41,102
What are we going to do now?

558
00:36:41,126 --> 00:36:42,227
Don't worry, Sifu.

559
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,834
We'll try to stop her.

560
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:47,770
Attaboy.

561
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:48,876
Qiang!

562
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,459
Help!

563
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,185
It's their family's business,

564
00:36:59,209 --> 00:36:59,894
how can outsiders butt in?

565
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:00,603
Eat up.

566
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,043
This is a bit salty.

567
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:05,376
I can explain, Jane...

568
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:08,251
You kept it.

569
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,449
I just forgot to throw it away.

570
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:19,727
Starting from tomorrow,
I'll be the one to make deliveries.

571
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,391
You stay behind and watch over the store.

572
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,793
You can coach them while you do that.

573
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,227
Honey...

574
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,602
Alright, alright...

575
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,001
It's okay, ma'am.

576
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,334
We can still make the deliveries.

577
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,394
Yeah, it's like a workout for us.

578
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,251
And we can get salted fish every meal.

579
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:52,959
Look at this little dork.

580
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,894
He can't keep his eyes away from

581
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:56,126
his old team uniform.

582
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,602
How old was he?

583
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:59,793
Twenty. A little older than you guys.

584
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,959
What was Sifu like?

585
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,251
He was cool.

586
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,376
He was the best lion dancer in town.

587
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:17,126
That's amazing.

588
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,209
Yeah.

589
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:21,293
I miss the old times, too.
I miss when he did the lion dance

590
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,126
and how happy it made him.

591
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:26,293
The first touch is on the forehead.

592
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:28,477
May the auspicious star shine brilliantly!

593
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:30,477
The second touch is on the eyes.

594
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:31,727
May the path be clear and bright!

595
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:34,810
What kind of groom
would do the lion dance himself?

596
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,418
How ridiculous!

597
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:38,352
He's the best lion
dancer around these parts.

598
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,418
What's wrong with him doing it himself?

599
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:44,352
Being good at the lion dance is useless.

600
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:45,894
His happiness matters the most.

601
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:47,185
Mind your own business.

602
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,852
Happiness doesn't pay the bills.

603
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,560
What a lost cause.

604
00:38:50,584 --> 00:38:52,834
Why did he stop?

605
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:55,584
Making a living ain't easy.

606
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,477
Being a lion dancer doesn't pay the bills.

607
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,251
So I stopped him.

608
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:01,168
Make sure you put your mind into this.

609
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:03,227
Don't make a fool out of yourself
during the competition.

610
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:03,853
We definitely will!

611
00:39:03,877 --> 00:39:05,668
Don't you worry, ma'am.

612
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,310
Doggie... Maybe you should
use something else as the "drum."

613
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,352
Don't worry, my belly is big and sturdy,

614
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:17,668
it sounds like a drum when I hit it.

615
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:19,834
Keep going!

616
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:35,060
Clean the third cabinet on the left.

617
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,168
I'm beat. I need a break.

618
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:55,560
Take them to get a new
lion head and a drum.

619
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:57,984
Don't you feel embarrassed
using a bamboo basket as the head?

620
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,126
And that fatso,

621
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,793
what he does is totally suicidal.

622
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:07,918
Right, right, right

623
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,043
we don't have kids,

624
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,756
I guess we can treat
them like they're our own.

625
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,709
What are we practicing today, Sifu?

626
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,709
I'm taking you guys somewhere today.

627
00:40:22,293 --> 00:40:23,543
Where?

628
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:25,751
Hop on.

629
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:38,209
What's wrong? Hop on.

630
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:40,418
Are you sure about this?

631
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:41,918
Yeah!

632
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,293
Quit dilly-dallying!

633
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:44,727
This motorcycle is from a good brand.

634
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,668
It's great quality.

635
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:51,561
Uh...

636
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:53,560
Did something just pop, Sifu?

637
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,019
Who lit up a fire cracker
in broad daylight?

638
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:56,602
Goodness gracious! Let's go!

639
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:58,918
Time to put this great motorcycle to use!

640
00:41:04,209 --> 00:41:05,145
Hang on tight!

641
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:06,352
This thing right here

642
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,126
is a beast on the roads!

643
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:15,918
We're here. Get off.

644
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,727
Selected from the finest water buffalo, the
leather has been sun dried multiple times.

645
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:31,894
So, the drumbeat is stunning!

646
00:41:31,918 --> 00:41:32,977
Lion head craft

647
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,685
has 600 years of history.

648
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:37,602
The lion head needs to be vivid and rugged.

649
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:38,769
Zhang Fei the Black Lion,

650
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:39,852
Ma Chao the White Lion,

651
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:40,853
Liu Bei the Yellow Lion

652
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:45,001
and Guan Yu the Red
Lion which I used to wield.

653
00:41:47,918 --> 00:41:49,418
What are you standing there for?

654
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:51,477
Pick a lion head

655
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,353
and a drum.

656
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,043
Woah!

657
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:57,001
Sifu.

658
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,102
Now that we have a lion head,
we can be a fierce lion, right?

659
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:00,043
Here.

660
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,376
Give me your best lion eyes.

661
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,418
Nope. You need more practice.

662
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:12,251
We've practiced for so long.

663
00:42:13,793 --> 00:42:16,793
Well, how about a friendly match?

664
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,459
Nice to meet you.

665
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:28,834
Pleasure to meet you.

666
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:30,477
Alright, you've greeted each other.

667
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:31,793
Since your sifu isn't here now,

668
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,001
I'll be the judge.

669
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:34,168
Are you okay with that?

670
00:42:34,876 --> 00:42:36,269
Yep.

671
00:42:36,293 --> 00:42:37,894
You were known as the Living Lion,

672
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:39,935
and respected by many.

673
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,102
You're also like an uncle to us!

674
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,144
We rookies are so thankful for the honor

675
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:45,352
of having you judge our friendly match.

676
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,293
C'mon. Let's give him a round of applause!

677
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:51,501
The rule is simple.

678
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:54,126
Whichever team gets the lettuce wins.

679
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,334
Here you go.

680
00:42:58,418 --> 00:42:59,418
Uncle,

681
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,668
are there any other rules?

682
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:04,334
Nope.

683
00:43:37,126 --> 00:43:38,126
Cheers.

684
00:43:53,668 --> 00:43:55,560
I thought you guys were
trying to be a fierce lion?

685
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:56,626
Show them what you've got!

686
00:44:58,584 --> 00:44:59,876
You can't pretend to be

687
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,501
a true fierce lion.

688
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:08,959
There, there.

689
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,727
You three might look like losers,

690
00:45:13,751 --> 00:45:16,918
but that doesn't mean
that you're real losers.

691
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,209
Gyun!

692
00:45:18,418 --> 00:45:19,709
Although you're scrawny,

693
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:21,418
you have the advantage

694
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:23,043
as a lion head.

695
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:25,084
However, you need high stamina.

696
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:27,876
Kat, you're agile

697
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:30,019
and have good balance

698
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:31,584
like a monkey.

699
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:33,894
It should be easy for you

700
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:36,501
to jump around while
holding someone so scrawny.

701
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:38,751
Doggie

702
00:45:38,918 --> 00:45:40,227
is big and strong

703
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:41,293
and has good arm strength.

704
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:43,126
Also,

705
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:45,043
after this friendly match,

706
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:49,376
I've noticed that you three
have one great strength.

707
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:52,834
Your tenaciousness.

708
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:55,918
Remember.

709
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:58,209
No matter who your opponents are.

710
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:00,876
A fierce lion always fights till the end.

711
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:02,084
Sifu.

712
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:04,001
What are our weaknesses then?

713
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:06,834
Your looks.

714
00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:09,269
Good thing is,

715
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:10,793
your faces are hidden under the lion.

716
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:12,418
Other than that, you are all set.

717
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:14,001
Understood.

718
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:15,501
Thanks, Sifu.

719
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:31,352
I ask the world

720
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:35,501
Is this the tallest mountain?

721
00:46:36,334 --> 00:46:38,477
Perhaps

722
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:42,459
There's another one taller than the sky

723
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,352
In this world

724
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:50,043
There are mountains taller than this one

725
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:52,227
But when it comes to love

726
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:56,459
I can't find one better than you

727
00:46:57,084 --> 00:47:04,144
There's always a taller mountain

728
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:11,918
True love is as great as the sky

729
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:17,894
No one knows who the world's
most powerful martial arts master is

730
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,793
This is your first time going on a stake.

731
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:21,894
Wooden stakes represent a mountain.

732
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,310
A lion dancing on wooden stakes

733
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:24,894
is to depict a fierce lion

734
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:26,918
as it picks the lettuce on a mountain.

735
00:47:27,418 --> 00:47:30,310
Your opponent is not other lions anymore.

736
00:47:30,334 --> 00:47:31,959
But the path under your feet.

737
00:47:32,126 --> 00:47:33,584
Watch every step.

738
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:37,001
Every step needs to exhibit
the spirit of a fierce lion.

739
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:38,668
Sifu,

740
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:40,935
how should we walk then?

741
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,126
You got any secret moves?

742
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:43,751
Listen to your heart.

743
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:45,751
Do you hear a puny cat? Or a fierce lion?

744
00:47:45,918 --> 00:47:47,418
A fierce lion.

745
00:47:54,459 --> 00:48:01,560
There's always a taller mountain

746
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:08,876
True love is as great as the sky

747
00:48:10,168 --> 00:48:15,459
No one knows who the world's most
powerful martial arts master is

748
00:48:17,084 --> 00:48:23,876
Perhaps we all have the same goal
but different paths

749
00:48:24,126 --> 00:48:31,019
But when it comes to love,
I can't find one better than you

750
00:48:31,043 --> 00:48:39,043
In my world, you are the best

751
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:49,418
Sifu,

752
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,661
why is there a pole placed
in front of the stake array?

753
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:53,001
No one will jump onto that.

754
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:54,293
That pole

755
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:55,834
is called the Sky's Pillar.

756
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:58,626
It's a reminder for the lion dancers
to remain humble.

757
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:02,959
And that there's always
a "mountain" that they can't conquer.

758
00:49:03,376 --> 00:49:05,685
You were so amazing when you were young.

759
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,251
I bet you could jump onto it.

760
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:08,834
I...

761
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:10,668
couldn't.

762
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:14,056
Don't be an idiot and try to jump onto it.

763
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:31,168
Where's Sifu?

764
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:32,685
He went to buy something from the store.

765
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:34,001
He told us to come first.

766
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:35,852
This is the qualifier
match we're talking about.

767
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:36,394
Without Sifu...

768
00:49:36,418 --> 00:49:37,102
Attention, please.

769
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:38,061
I'm a little freaked out.

770
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:40,227
Now we'll begin to draw lots.

771
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:42,310
The teams that get the same number

772
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:44,584
will compete against each other.

773
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:51,269
Why are you making deliveries

774
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:52,977
alone on a hot sunny day?

775
00:49:53,001 --> 00:49:55,227
You can't carry that much fish by yourself,

776
00:49:55,251 --> 00:49:56,435
so you have to make multiple trips.

777
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:57,810
I'm so sorry.

778
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:59,269
I'll make the next trip quick. Don't worry.

779
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:01,668
Where's Qiang?

780
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:04,102
He... has important business to attend to.

781
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,376
What important business can a loser has?

782
00:50:07,626 --> 00:50:09,352
He's a lion dance coach now.

783
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,019
I just want him to focus
on training the team.

784
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:12,626
He's back at it again?

785
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:15,977
Can't he grow up and realize it's
more important to bring food to the table?

786
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:17,685
What kind of a man

787
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:19,060
would focus on stupid stuff like that?

788
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:20,352
How are you supposed to

789
00:50:20,376 --> 00:50:21,977
make all these deliveries by yourself?

790
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:23,269
You still have so many places to stop by.

791
00:50:23,293 --> 00:50:25,560
Look at the life you're living.
Back then, if you'd...

792
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:26,894
Alright, say no more.

793
00:50:26,918 --> 00:50:29,001
I'll get it over to you
on time, don't sweat it.

794
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:41,168
Where the heck is Sifu?

795
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:17,626
Why did you come back?

796
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:19,161
Here, honey, have some water.

797
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:20,810
Go rest. I'll make this run.

798
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:22,126
What are you doing?

799
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,644
They're competing!

800
00:51:23,668 --> 00:51:26,227
Why aren't you there?
Now is not the time to deliver salted fish.

801
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,251
It's okay.

802
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,376
Get off the scooter.

803
00:51:29,459 --> 00:51:30,543
You hear me?

804
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,418
Haven't you ever regretted all these years?

805
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:41,584
My feelings for you have never changed.

806
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:45,501
I'm talking about me
not letting you lion dance,

807
00:51:45,543 --> 00:51:47,668
and not letting you do
those dangerous dance moves.

808
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:48,686
Like other people,

809
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,727
I told you to get a real job.

810
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:50,645
I told you to make money.

811
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:51,769
I told you to settle
with selling salted fish.

812
00:51:51,793 --> 00:51:54,168
I'm the reason people call you a loser.

813
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,043
I don't regret it.

814
00:51:58,376 --> 00:52:00,251
We have a good life together.

815
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,793
But I do!

816
00:52:13,043 --> 00:52:14,043
Honey!

817
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:16,102
I love you!

818
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:17,394
You better win the championship!

819
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:19,043
Or I'm going to break your legs!

820
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:31,227
Team Chen's Village wins.

821
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,251
It's our turn.

822
00:52:40,376 --> 00:52:42,209
Sifu is still not here.

823
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:44,084
You guys seem nervous.

824
00:52:44,918 --> 00:52:46,644
Be careful, don't slip
when you're up there.

825
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,251
Or you'll end up like those guys.

826
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:00,293
I've never heard of that team.

827
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:01,793
Just treat it like a clown show.

828
00:53:09,293 --> 00:53:11,310
Are we really going to do this?

829
00:53:11,334 --> 00:53:12,685
I say forget it.

830
00:53:12,709 --> 00:53:14,709
We shouldn't ruin Sifu's reputation.

831
00:53:14,876 --> 00:53:15,561
Get up there!

832
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:17,394
Are you guys going to do this or what?

833
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:19,019
Get up there!

834
00:53:19,043 --> 00:53:20,668
What are you waiting for?

835
00:53:20,709 --> 00:53:21,894
Stop wasting time!

836
00:53:21,918 --> 00:53:23,501
I can't stand you guys!

837
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:34,918
Let's do this!

838
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:53,834
Sorry!

839
00:53:55,043 --> 00:53:56,209
I'm late.

840
00:53:58,584 --> 00:54:00,001
How did it go?

841
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:05,834
It's okay.

842
00:54:06,126 --> 00:54:07,501
We can try again next time.

843
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:10,126
Next time?

844
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:21,477
Sifu!

845
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,959
Thank you!

846
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:25,959
I'd like to thank you guys, too.

847
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,793
Let's go eat!

848
00:54:32,626 --> 00:54:34,168
I heard you guys did great today.

849
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:35,435
Of course!

850
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:36,584
Don't get cocky!

851
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:38,310
The next round will be harder to win.
You need to continue to practice.

852
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:39,501
Yep!

853
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:40,626
Now, let's eat!

854
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:42,501
Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:54:42,918 --> 00:54:44,751
We're having a feast today!

856
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:45,603
Gyun.

857
00:54:45,627 --> 00:54:47,626
Your dream is about to come true.

858
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:48,810
What dream?

859
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:49,561
I know.

860
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:50,935
Gyun wants to compete in Guangzhou,

861
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:54,168
so he can show his parents that
he's no longer a puny cat.

862
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,084
That's very nice of you.

863
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:58,293
Here, have some more.

864
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:00,626
Gyun!

865
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,394
Your grandpa has been
looking everywhere for you.

866
00:55:05,418 --> 00:55:06,501
What for?

867
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:09,668
He said your parents are back.

868
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:12,043
Go ahead!

869
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,209
Allow me to excuse myself, Sifu.

870
00:55:35,709 --> 00:55:36,709
Thank you.

871
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:42,001
I'm back, Grandpa!

872
00:55:42,043 --> 00:55:43,876
Dad! Mom!

873
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:50,793
What happened?

874
00:55:56,168 --> 00:55:57,293
Is Dad

875
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:58,876
asleep?

876
00:56:09,543 --> 00:56:10,626
Your dad

877
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:12,876
fell when he was working
on the construction site.

878
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:15,168
His vitals are stable now,

879
00:56:16,126 --> 00:56:17,918
but he's still in a coma.

880
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:22,001
What did the doctor say?

881
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:30,626
The doctor said we can take him home

882
00:56:30,959 --> 00:56:33,168
and if a miracle happens,

883
00:56:33,376 --> 00:56:36,001
he might wake up.

884
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,251
Your uniform...

885
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:57,959
Gyun!

886
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:00,793
Give him some space.

887
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:06,043
I'm an idiot!

888
00:57:06,293 --> 00:57:07,543
This is my fault.

889
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:10,001
I wasn't specific enough.

890
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:14,334
I only asked them to return soon.

891
00:57:14,834 --> 00:57:17,751
I left out the "healthy and safe" part.

892
00:57:20,709 --> 00:57:22,584
Sometimes I really wonder

893
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:26,209
if you actually exist.

894
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:29,852
If you do,

895
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:32,126
then why would this happen?

896
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:37,709
Can you tell me

897
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:40,376
what I need to do for
the miracle to happen?

898
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:52,376
Grandpa.

899
00:57:52,626 --> 00:57:53,626
Mom.

900
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:55,084
I'm going to Guangzhou.

901
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:02,043
Gyun.

902
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:07,209
Mom.

903
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:08,584
I've grown up.

904
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:10,251
Don't worry about me.

905
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:12,543
Stay home and take care of Dad and Grandpa.

906
00:58:13,168 --> 00:58:14,918
Don't worry about the money.

907
00:58:15,168 --> 00:58:16,334
I'll take care of it.

908
00:58:26,959 --> 00:58:28,126
We have to go!

909
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:30,376
Alright, guys. I have to go.

910
00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:44,334
Thank you, Sifu, Mrs. Qiang.

911
00:58:52,626 --> 00:58:54,227
Quit with the long face.

912
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,376
Train hard.

913
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:57,263
I'll be back as soon as
I make enough money.

914
00:58:57,543 --> 00:58:59,876
You can't participate in
the competition without me.

915
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:25,876
Gyun.

916
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:29,793
Take good care of yourself in Guangzhou.

917
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:33,918
We'll wait for you to come back.

918
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:37,584
No matter what happens out there,

919
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:40,394
you have to remember our team's drumbeat!

920
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:43,269
As long as the drumbeat
echoes in your heart,

921
00:59:43,293 --> 00:59:44,959
we'll always be a fierce lion!

922
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:46,394
We have to

923
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:49,084
keep being a fierce lion!

924
00:59:53,543 --> 00:59:55,334
Don't worry, Sifu!

925
00:59:55,543 --> 00:59:56,793
He'll be back.

926
01:00:00,251 --> 01:00:02,459
Hey, buddy

927
01:00:04,626 --> 01:00:08,918
You can slow down a little

928
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:13,334
Carry your belongings

929
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:17,209
Wear a red wreath on your head

930
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:21,626
Forget all your sorrows

931
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:26,501
I'll be your companion

932
01:00:28,168 --> 01:00:30,626
Rolling on

933
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:35,918
Carpe diem

934
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:40,644
Sing wim-wom-wom-bo

935
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:45,084
Then keep rollin', rollin' on

936
01:00:46,418 --> 01:00:48,918
You only live once

937
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:50,043
Hello?

938
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:51,543
Gyun.

939
01:00:51,876 --> 01:00:52,853
How've you been?

940
01:00:52,877 --> 01:00:53,977
Hey, Gyun. When are you coming back?

941
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:54,895
Come home soon!

942
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:56,759
We're waiting for you
to join the competition!

943
01:01:00,626 --> 01:01:03,334
Rolling on

944
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:07,501
For our generation

945
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:13,810
Most people take world-weariness as normal

946
01:01:13,834 --> 01:01:17,894
Perhaps in this world

947
01:01:17,918 --> 01:01:22,001
There's nothing worth looking forward to

948
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:26,168
But that has nothing to do with me

949
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:30,852
I'm just an idiot who wants to fly

950
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:35,751
Life should be celebrated heartily

951
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:50,418
Thanks, Boss.

952
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:52,144
Let's split this

953
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,334
among the three of us.

954
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,001
As for the rest,

955
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:56,584
we'll save it up for Gyun.

956
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:57,519
So he can take care of his family.

957
01:01:57,543 --> 01:01:58,543
Alright.

958
01:01:59,501 --> 01:02:01,751
What do you think Gyun is doing now?

959
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:03,685
I'm sure the big city life is too good

960
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:05,334
for him to want to come back.

961
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:08,126
Excuse me, where do I sleep?

962
01:02:08,418 --> 01:02:09,668
Under the bed.

963
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:24,168
Hello?

964
01:02:26,751 --> 01:02:28,293
That little stinker...

965
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:48,936
Sifu.

966
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,251
Is Gyun never coming back?

967
01:02:52,876 --> 01:02:54,751
Should we keep practicing?

968
01:03:06,418 --> 01:03:08,310
Woah... your wound looks gnarly.

969
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:09,501
What are they talking about?

970
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,019
They said there's a gig

971
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:11,894
that pays double.

972
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:12,918
Are you interested?

973
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:13,959
Where?

974
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:16,209
Shanghai?

975
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,501
Why leave in such a hurry?

976
01:03:17,584 --> 01:03:19,060
Mom. Don't worry.

977
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:20,584
I'm going with a few friends.

978
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:23,209
Did you get the money I sent you?

979
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:24,501
Yeah.

980
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:25,709
Oh, one more thing.

981
01:03:25,751 --> 01:03:27,019
Your three friends

982
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:29,310
came this morning with some money.

983
01:03:29,334 --> 01:03:31,060
You mean Kat, Doggie, and Sifu?

984
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:32,084
Right.

985
01:03:32,126 --> 01:03:33,227
I refused to accept it,

986
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:34,769
but then they left it and ran off.

987
01:03:34,793 --> 01:03:36,459
I couldn't even chase after them.

988
01:03:38,084 --> 01:03:39,084
Gyun.

989
01:03:40,293 --> 01:03:41,834
I'm sorry that you're suffering

990
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,168
because of us.

991
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:49,543
Be more patient and tolerant out there.

992
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,418
If you can't take it anymore,

993
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,709
just come home.

994
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,043
Mom...

995
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:57,685
What are you talking about?

996
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,751
I'm a grown man. I can
provide for the family.

997
01:04:01,043 --> 01:04:01,603
Sifu.

998
01:04:01,627 --> 01:04:03,935
Why didn't they invite us to eat with them?

999
01:04:03,959 --> 01:04:05,185
Are you serious?

1000
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:07,209
We agreed to get our own dinner.

1001
01:04:07,668 --> 01:04:09,227
They're stingy.

1002
01:04:09,251 --> 01:04:10,918
It's just the three of us.

1003
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:12,477
Well, you're the one to blame

1004
01:04:12,501 --> 01:04:14,102
for being so big.

1005
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:15,602
They're afraid you'd eat all their food.

1006
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:16,520
That's why they didn't invite us in.

1007
01:04:16,544 --> 01:04:20,251
The Lion Dance Games will be
held in Lychee Bay next week.

1008
01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:21,935
To encourage the participants

1009
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,102
to spread the culture and tradition,

1010
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,269
great prizes will be given out to the
champion in this tournament.

1011
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:27,584
Are we still going, Sifu?

1012
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,394
We're one person short.

1013
01:04:29,418 --> 01:04:31,751
Many media channels will
live stream the tournament.

1014
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:44,185
Sorry.

1015
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:45,709
Thank you.

1016
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:51,001
Is this yours?

1017
01:04:52,918 --> 01:04:53,977
Yeah.

1018
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,043
Thank you.

1019
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:04,310
I'm heading in the same direction

1020
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:05,644
as the place you're
dropping those parcels off.

1021
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,293
So, don't feel bad.

1022
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:08,834
Thank you.

1023
01:05:10,084 --> 01:05:12,543
You are so young and
starts working already.

1024
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:14,501
Just wanna gain more life experience.

1025
01:05:14,584 --> 01:05:15,334
Oh, right!

1026
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,685
That lion head that I gave you,

1027
01:05:16,709 --> 01:05:18,584
did you use it to practice lion dancing?

1028
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,126
No?

1029
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:25,459
That's a bummer.

1030
01:05:26,209 --> 01:05:29,185
My family didn't want me to
keep doing it because I'm a girl.

1031
01:05:29,209 --> 01:05:30,810
So, after being the
promotional ambassador this time,

1032
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:32,876
I won't compete in any games anymore.

1033
01:05:33,126 --> 01:05:35,269
I was wondering if I'd see the young guy

1034
01:05:35,293 --> 01:05:37,394
with the exact same name as mine,

1035
01:05:37,418 --> 01:05:38,977
jumping and dancing

1036
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,401
with that red lion head I gave him.

1037
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:43,168
But never mind.

1038
01:05:51,043 --> 01:05:52,709
This is it.

1039
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:54,459
Thank you.

1040
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:01,126
Hey.

1041
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:02,959
Don't forget that

1042
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:05,209
You're chosen by the Hero Flower!

1043
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:06,543
You can do it!

1044
01:06:21,876 --> 01:06:24,310
Big cities are way too busy,

1045
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,935
so I didn't prepare much for you guys.

1046
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:27,709
I packed light.

1047
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,459
Alright.

1048
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:31,977
You guys might bump into Gyun.

1049
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,584
Remember to give these things to him.

1050
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:35,418
He's all alone in a big city.

1051
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:36,668
He has it rough.

1052
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,269
Okay.

1053
01:06:38,293 --> 01:06:40,644
So... What if we don't see him?

1054
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:42,334
Then you bring all these back of course!

1055
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:43,793
Got it.

1056
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,793
Woah! It's a lion dance tournament!

1057
01:06:50,626 --> 01:06:52,626
Gyun! Where are you going?

1058
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:53,751
Work.

1059
01:06:54,126 --> 01:06:55,709
We're leaving tomorrow.

1060
01:06:55,793 --> 01:06:57,418
I won't get paid if I don't go.

1061
01:06:57,501 --> 01:07:00,019
You've taken multiple jobs,
but you're still that in need of money?

1062
01:07:00,043 --> 01:07:01,293
How much do you need?

1063
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,501
I don't know and that's
the most terrifying part.

1064
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:09,251
That is really terrifying...

1065
01:07:29,668 --> 01:07:32,769
Since plenty of teams made it through
the qualifiers in every division,

1066
01:07:32,793 --> 01:07:34,227
the agenda of this tournament

1067
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,769
is going to be very tight.

1068
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:38,769
The rematch will officially
start at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

1069
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:41,060
Teams who have passed the rematch

1070
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:43,102
will go directly to the elimination round
after a short break.

1071
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:44,326
Then we'll move to the finals.

1072
01:07:45,834 --> 01:07:47,209
What happened to you?

1073
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:49,560
You're 30 minutes late!

1074
01:07:49,584 --> 01:07:51,418
Do you know what the consequences are?

1075
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:53,560
Sorry. I've got way too
many delivery orders.

1076
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:55,834
So that gave you the
excuse to deliver ours last?

1077
01:07:55,959 --> 01:07:57,519
We had to train with an empty stomach!

1078
01:07:57,543 --> 01:07:58,543
That's enough.

1079
01:08:01,709 --> 01:08:02,709
I'll pay you.

1080
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,584
You were a lion dancer?

1081
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:24,876
What the...

1082
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:26,376
The soup is all spilled out!

1083
01:08:26,959 --> 01:08:28,168
You had one job.

1084
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:29,709
What a loser.

1085
01:08:30,709 --> 01:08:31,834
I'm not a loser.

1086
01:08:34,168 --> 01:08:35,168
Then what are you?

1087
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:47,144
As long as the drumbeat
echoes in your heart,

1088
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:49,043
we'll always be a fierce lion!

1089
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:54,209
Sifu.

1090
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:55,978
Are you sure about doing this tomorrow?

1091
01:08:56,293 --> 01:08:57,602
The tournament will last all day.

1092
01:08:57,626 --> 01:08:59,269
Can you handle it?

1093
01:08:59,293 --> 01:09:00,793
I don't have a choice.

1094
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:02,084
Why?

1095
01:09:03,168 --> 01:09:05,376
Because the tournament
will be live streamed.

1096
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:08,418
Do you know what that means?

1097
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:10,668
What?

1098
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:13,459
That means

1099
01:09:14,209 --> 01:09:15,876
Gyun might see us.

1100
01:09:17,293 --> 01:09:19,459
I might fall from the stakes,

1101
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:21,352
but I want Gyun to know:

1102
01:09:21,376 --> 01:09:23,418
Do not surrender.

1103
01:09:45,084 --> 01:09:46,793
Mhm, never surrender.

1104
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,001
So what if I'm old?

1105
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:49,418
I won't surrender.

1106
01:09:49,918 --> 01:09:51,518
So what if I don't have enough strength?

1107
01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:52,709
I won't surrender.

1108
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:55,334
I hope that Gyun won't surrender to

1109
01:09:55,376 --> 01:09:57,418
what he's experiencing right now.

1110
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:01,959
Do you think Gyun is
still practicing lion dancing?

1111
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:04,418
That's not important.

1112
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,376
Our lives

1113
01:10:06,584 --> 01:10:08,144
are like a lion dance.

1114
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:10,668
There are ups and downs.

1115
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:13,709
Gyun has his own path.

1116
01:13:06,584 --> 01:13:07,668
Sifu,

1117
01:13:08,293 --> 01:13:10,043
I couldn't see the end of the mountain.

1118
01:13:10,751 --> 01:13:12,543
I have no choice but to move forward.

1119
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:18,584
Where is your lion head?

1120
01:13:19,126 --> 01:13:19,811
I'm leaving it behind.

1121
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:21,418
What a bummer.

1122
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:25,959
Woah, this place is bustling.

1123
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:28,791
Do you wanna check it out?

1124
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:31,126
Forget about it. We have a train to catch.

1125
01:13:35,459 --> 01:13:37,769
Over a hundred teams showed up today.

1126
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:40,043
This is unprecedented.

1127
01:13:40,251 --> 01:13:41,935
Hey, we're gonna miss the train.

1128
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,019
It's okay. The station isn't far.

1129
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:46,403
Not like we have anything to do,
even if we get there early.

1130
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:47,626
Let's check it out.

1131
01:13:56,918 --> 01:13:57,645
Now,

1132
01:13:57,669 --> 01:14:01,043
let's welcome the lion dance teams
with a round of applause.

1133
01:14:03,959 --> 01:14:05,043
Let's do this.

1134
01:14:15,876 --> 01:14:16,728
Alright.

1135
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,459
Seems like every team is ready to roll.

1136
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:20,810
Hurry, hurry!

1137
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:22,894
Now let's begin the first
round of the tournament.

1138
01:14:22,918 --> 01:14:25,477
Every team will perform their
freestyle lion dance

1139
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:26,769
following the drumbeat.

1140
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:28,918
The judges will eliminate half of the teams

1141
01:14:29,168 --> 01:14:31,918
according to their performance.

1142
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:56,918
Sifu, it has started.

1143
01:14:58,584 --> 01:15:00,685
Are you meditating, Sifu?

1144
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:03,418
Has Sifu reached parinirvana?

1145
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:05,334
I'm waiting.

1146
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,894
What are you waiting for?

1147
01:15:06,918 --> 01:15:08,644
It started a few minutes ago.

1148
01:15:08,668 --> 01:15:11,269
I'm waiting for a judge to see us.

1149
01:15:11,293 --> 01:15:12,293
Why?

1150
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:13,435
Are you stupid?

1151
01:15:13,459 --> 01:15:14,394
There are way too many teams here.

1152
01:15:14,418 --> 01:15:15,395
Why would I waste my strength

1153
01:15:15,419 --> 01:15:17,209
when they're not looking at us?

1154
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:18,584
Get ready.

1155
01:15:19,126 --> 01:15:20,102
Follow my footsteps.

1156
01:15:20,126 --> 01:15:21,102
Then throw me upwards.

1157
01:15:21,126 --> 01:15:22,126
Got it.

1158
01:15:25,709 --> 01:15:26,478
Doggie.

1159
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:27,668
The bridge!

1160
01:15:29,043 --> 01:15:30,251
Oh... the Bridge!

1161
01:15:39,793 --> 01:15:41,626
Stand up slowly.

1162
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:50,310
- This team is amazing!
- Yeah!

1163
01:15:50,334 --> 01:15:54,019
Team Salted Fish's
performance is outstanding!

1164
01:15:54,043 --> 01:15:55,644
This team's lion head dancer

1165
01:15:55,668 --> 01:15:58,560
is 45 years old.

1166
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:00,019
This is considered old for lion dancing.

1167
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:03,310
Why is he participating in
such a fierce tournament?

1168
01:16:03,334 --> 01:16:05,727
Is there a story behind this?

1169
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:06,834
Honey!

1170
01:16:07,543 --> 01:16:09,060
That's my husband!

1171
01:16:09,084 --> 01:16:10,310
Qiang? The loser?

1172
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:12,043
He's a champ!

1173
01:16:13,251 --> 01:16:16,376
Now only half of the teams are left.

1174
01:16:16,459 --> 01:16:20,019
The second round is
Embroidered Ball Snatching.

1175
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:21,852
There will be four lanes.

1176
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:23,769
On the finish line of each lane,

1177
01:16:23,793 --> 01:16:25,269
there will be only one embroidered ball.

1178
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:28,227
Whichever team gets the ball
will enter the next round.

1179
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:31,376
Each team can send two lions at the most.

1180
01:16:32,043 --> 01:16:32,811
Sifu,

1181
01:16:32,835 --> 01:16:34,060
we only have one lion,

1182
01:16:34,084 --> 01:16:35,227
there's no way we can beat them.

1183
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:35,918
Right.

1184
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:37,310
Let's not over think this.

1185
01:16:37,334 --> 01:16:39,376
Hurry up and pick a lane with less teams.

1186
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:45,644
Team Salted Fish

1187
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:47,560
only erected one flag.

1188
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:50,043
Seems like they're just sending
one lion for this round.

1189
01:16:50,751 --> 01:16:53,043
That's a bold move.

1190
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:55,102
There is one lion less over at that lane.
Let's go over there.

1191
01:16:55,126 --> 01:16:58,001
Hurry, go over there.

1192
01:16:59,043 --> 01:17:00,626
I can't go any further. Stop moving.

1193
01:17:01,251 --> 01:17:02,145
Sifu,

1194
01:17:02,169 --> 01:17:04,102
this lane had the least people,

1195
01:17:04,126 --> 01:17:06,709
now it has the most people.

1196
01:17:07,334 --> 01:17:08,126
Don't sweat it.

1197
01:17:08,334 --> 01:17:10,459
Let's switch.

1198
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:12,459
Go back.

1199
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:13,751
Alright.

1200
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:15,334
Hey!

1201
01:17:15,376 --> 01:17:16,810
You guys saw that right?

1202
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:18,459
The Salted Fish guys are good.

1203
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:19,376
How about

1204
01:17:19,459 --> 01:17:20,727
we each use one lion

1205
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:22,310
to work together and
kick them out of the tournament?

1206
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:23,751
He has a point.

1207
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:26,185
You guys are funny.

1208
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:28,126
We're being serious!

1209
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:35,394
Ready!

1210
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:36,418
Go!

1211
01:17:41,376 --> 01:17:42,311
Seems like the battle

1212
01:17:42,335 --> 01:17:44,519
in Lane 3 is the most fierce!

1213
01:17:44,543 --> 01:17:46,209
Many teams are falling into the water.

1214
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:48,727
Looks like the Salted Fish team

1215
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:51,019
is being ganged up on by the other teams!

1216
01:17:51,043 --> 01:17:52,894
But the rules for this round

1217
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:53,977
don't forbid teams

1218
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:55,834
from joining forces.

1219
01:17:59,168 --> 01:18:02,668
Sucks for that team.

1220
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:18,227
Sifu! I can't hold up much longer!

1221
01:18:18,251 --> 01:18:20,543
Shut up and save your energy!

1222
01:18:43,168 --> 01:18:46,459
We have to keep being a fierce lion!

1223
01:18:48,418 --> 01:18:50,334
Sifu, what should we do?

1224
01:18:51,668 --> 01:18:52,727
Sifu,

1225
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:55,032
are you sure you're not hiding some
secret ultimate moves?

1226
01:18:56,043 --> 01:18:57,126
Alright then.

1227
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:58,769
It's time

1228
01:18:58,793 --> 01:19:01,501
to reveal my secret weapon.

1229
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:04,394
Years of hard work

1230
01:19:04,418 --> 01:19:05,543
and suffering,

1231
01:19:05,626 --> 01:19:06,918
and pain...

1232
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:08,876
All of those things

1233
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:12,001
have cost me sweat and blood.

1234
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:14,168
But as a result,

1235
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:17,001
I've obtained something that
most people don't have...

1236
01:19:19,584 --> 01:19:21,519
Salted...

1237
01:19:21,543 --> 01:19:22,894
Fish...

1238
01:19:22,918 --> 01:19:25,126
Feet!

1239
01:19:27,793 --> 01:19:28,810
I thought that

1240
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:29,852
Sifu trained us underwater

1241
01:19:29,876 --> 01:19:31,352
was to increase our lung capacity.

1242
01:19:31,376 --> 01:19:32,459
I never would have guessed

1243
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:34,918
it was actually for this moment.

1244
01:20:18,043 --> 01:20:18,793
Sifu.

1245
01:20:18,876 --> 01:20:20,144
Your feet don't stink anymore!

1246
01:20:20,168 --> 01:20:21,834
What's going on?

1247
01:20:24,251 --> 01:20:27,251
Who brings air freshener to a tournament?

1248
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:37,793
The other 3 lanes have finished this round.

1249
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:40,685
Only Lane 3 is still
fighting over the ball.

1250
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:41,561
Team Salted Fish

1251
01:20:41,585 --> 01:20:44,185
is obviously struggling with only one lion.

1252
01:20:44,209 --> 01:20:45,145
We can see that

1253
01:20:45,169 --> 01:20:47,685
they're tiring out.

1254
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,001
Alright, let's go.

1255
01:20:53,043 --> 01:20:54,020
How dare you use your stinky feet on us!

1256
01:20:54,044 --> 01:20:55,543
This is going to be the end of you!

1257
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:17,894
Team Salted Fish set up
an ambush beforehand!

1258
01:21:17,918 --> 01:21:19,060
Now there's a young man

1259
01:21:19,084 --> 01:21:21,394
holding the team's flag
at the end of the lane.

1260
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,668
He brought the second lion.

1261
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:30,793
Gyun!

1262
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:31,834
Sifu!

1263
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:32,728
I'll take over.

1264
01:21:32,752 --> 01:21:33,959
Hurry, Kat!

1265
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,834
I'm full of energy right now.

1266
01:21:40,918 --> 01:21:42,126
Bring it on!

1267
01:22:05,584 --> 01:22:06,876
Amazing!

1268
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:09,477
The battle at Lane 3 is finally over!

1269
01:22:09,501 --> 01:22:11,810
We officially have the four teams

1270
01:22:11,834 --> 01:22:13,626
who are going to the semi-finals!

1271
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:37,043
Gyun.

1272
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,459
Sifu.

1273
01:22:45,626 --> 01:22:46,834
Sorry I'm late.

1274
01:22:52,209 --> 01:22:53,209
Son,

1275
01:22:53,793 --> 01:22:55,209
you've gotten stronger.

1276
01:22:55,668 --> 01:22:56,751
Hey, Gyun.

1277
01:23:04,293 --> 01:23:06,501
We're going to the semi-finals.

1278
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:10,251
The top four teams will
be dueling one-on-one.

1279
01:23:11,168 --> 01:23:13,560
This round of competition
is Lettuce Picking.

1280
01:23:13,584 --> 01:23:15,144
An array will be setup on the stage

1281
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:17,060
and there will be five heads of lettuce.

1282
01:23:17,084 --> 01:23:18,144
Contestants must

1283
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:20,834
complete the competition without
damaging the array.

1284
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:23,477
The first team to obtain three heads
of lettuce will win.

1285
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:24,668
Ready.

1286
01:23:55,709 --> 01:23:58,435
Team Limitless defeated the mighty

1287
01:23:58,459 --> 01:23:59,560
Team Chen's Village with ease.

1288
01:23:59,584 --> 01:24:01,876
They're the first team
qualified for the final.

1289
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:18,310
Team Salted Fish wins!

1290
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:20,394
This team that wasn't very well-known

1291
01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:21,894
is definitely a dark horse

1292
01:24:21,918 --> 01:24:23,644
in this year's tournament!

1293
01:24:23,668 --> 01:24:26,060
They've done amazingly
and turned their situations around!

1294
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:27,894
Team Salted Fish will enter the final

1295
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:29,560
against Team Limitless!

1296
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:31,602
That guy looks familiar.

1297
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:33,251
He's the food delivery boy.

1298
01:24:39,334 --> 01:24:40,334
Gyun.

1299
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:44,209
We're counting on you.

1300
01:24:47,459 --> 01:24:49,501
Those guys are ruthless.

1301
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:50,709
I got carried away

1302
01:24:50,834 --> 01:24:52,234
and I failed to dodge their attack.

1303
01:24:54,501 --> 01:24:56,126
Ladies and gentlemen!

1304
01:24:56,251 --> 01:24:59,769
A thrilling final is about to begin!

1305
01:24:59,793 --> 01:25:01,810
Please give a round of
applause to Team Limitless

1306
01:25:01,834 --> 01:25:04,418
and Team Salted Fish!

1307
01:25:06,043 --> 01:25:06,645
Focus.

1308
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:09,019
This year's tournament has
revived many traditional events.

1309
01:25:09,043 --> 01:25:10,020
Today's final

1310
01:25:10,044 --> 01:25:13,310
will be conducted with the
traditional long bench array.

1311
01:25:13,334 --> 01:25:15,310
The long benches might seem harmless,

1312
01:25:15,334 --> 01:25:17,094
but it's difficult to
stay balanced on them.

1313
01:25:18,001 --> 01:25:20,477
We saw what Team Limitless is capable of.

1314
01:25:20,501 --> 01:25:21,560
This match

1315
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,394
is going to be a tough battle
for Team Salted Fish.

1316
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:24,459
Begin!

1317
01:25:27,001 --> 01:25:29,043
A little show of dominance!

1318
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:31,685
Team Salted Fish is catching up again!

1319
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,376
They have an advantage with speed.

1320
01:25:33,459 --> 01:25:35,259
Team Limitless once
again has the upper hand.

1321
01:25:35,793 --> 01:25:37,394
Team Salted Fish caught up again!

1322
01:25:37,418 --> 01:25:38,751
Amazing stamina!

1323
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:40,793
The match is getting intense!

1324
01:25:46,168 --> 01:25:48,043
Woah! This kick!

1325
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,269
Can Team Salted Fish withstand it?

1326
01:25:50,293 --> 01:25:52,126
Going toe-to-toe like this

1327
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:54,294
puts Team Salted Fish at
an extreme disadvantage!

1328
01:26:01,584 --> 01:26:03,001
Team Salted Fish is striking back!

1329
01:26:04,543 --> 01:26:06,227
Both teams are clinging
to the bench with their legs!

1330
01:26:06,251 --> 01:26:08,131
The conditions are
getting even more difficult!

1331
01:26:20,501 --> 01:26:21,918
We have a result!

1332
01:26:35,543 --> 01:26:36,876
It's a tie!

1333
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:39,709
We have a tie! Unbelievable!

1334
01:26:39,793 --> 01:26:43,793
Looks like we're entering overtime!

1335
01:26:48,918 --> 01:26:49,918
Does it hurt?

1336
01:26:50,168 --> 01:26:51,168
Nope.

1337
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:52,418
Don't try to act tough.

1338
01:26:52,626 --> 01:26:53,626
Safety first.

1339
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:54,626
Sifu.

1340
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,435
All of us want to win
for once in our lives.

1341
01:26:56,459 --> 01:26:56,895
Right.

1342
01:26:56,919 --> 01:26:58,269
The overtime will be conducted

1343
01:26:58,293 --> 01:27:00,269
with the stakes we used
during the exhibition match!

1344
01:27:00,293 --> 01:27:02,560
Each team will perform a lion dance

1345
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:03,894
and will be scored by the judges.

1346
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,727
This stake array

1347
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:07,810
is the tallest in the
history of this tournament.

1348
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:11,144
The tallest stake, the
Blue Stake is 16 meters,

1349
01:27:11,168 --> 01:27:13,977
and the distance between stakes is twice
as far as the conventional arrays.

1350
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,394
After the intense battle just now,

1351
01:27:15,418 --> 01:27:16,353
this is a true test of stamina

1352
01:27:16,377 --> 01:27:19,519
for both teams.

1353
01:27:19,543 --> 01:27:20,977
First, we have

1354
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:22,894
a topnotch team in this year's tournament!

1355
01:27:22,918 --> 01:27:24,376
Team Limitless!

1356
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:26,501
Go, go!

1357
01:27:38,751 --> 01:27:40,560
Team Limitless hopped
onto the array with style!

1358
01:27:40,584 --> 01:27:42,904
Seems like they're very determined
to win the championship!

1359
01:27:44,584 --> 01:27:46,477
The water splash is also called "jian cai."
Seeing wealth

1360
01:27:46,501 --> 01:27:47,876
It's a metaphor for good fortune!

1361
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:00,543
Gyun. Your foot.

1362
01:28:03,418 --> 01:28:05,584
Team Limitless is about to reach the top!

1363
01:28:05,793 --> 01:28:06,686
The Blue Stake is the last hurdle

1364
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:09,168
for their success!

1365
01:28:12,209 --> 01:28:14,185
Team Limitless made it

1366
01:28:14,209 --> 01:28:16,269
to the Blue Stake smoothly!

1367
01:28:16,293 --> 01:28:18,935
They've completed the
most challenging part!

1368
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:21,251
They should score pretty high.

1369
01:28:26,209 --> 01:28:28,644
Team Limitless' performance is flawless!

1370
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:31,685
Champion! Champion!

1371
01:28:31,709 --> 01:28:33,477
This is not looking good

1372
01:28:33,501 --> 01:28:35,126
for Team Salted Fish!

1373
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:36,209
Wait!

1374
01:28:36,293 --> 01:28:38,543
Seems like Team Salted
Fish has a situation.

1375
01:28:41,084 --> 01:28:42,584
He needs rest.

1376
01:28:42,626 --> 01:28:43,977
Do you have another team member?

1377
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:44,895
I can take his place!

1378
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:46,769
No, contestants are

1379
01:28:46,793 --> 01:28:47,685
not allowed to switch teams.

1380
01:28:47,709 --> 01:28:48,228
Why?

1381
01:28:48,252 --> 01:28:49,918
A rule is a rule!

1382
01:28:50,126 --> 01:28:51,185
What kind of stupid rule is that?

1383
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:52,543
We forfeit.

1384
01:28:53,084 --> 01:28:54,084
Sifu.

1385
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:55,209
I can do it.

1386
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:56,293
Gyun.

1387
01:28:56,376 --> 01:28:57,816
We made it all the way to the final.

1388
01:28:57,876 --> 01:28:59,185
We've proven ourselves.

1389
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,209
Sifu.

1390
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:01,918
You told us

1391
01:29:02,584 --> 01:29:04,209
a fierce lion fights until the end.

1392
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:15,376
Team Salted Fish has decided to continue!

1393
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,709
Such amazing willpower!

1394
01:29:31,626 --> 01:29:32,751
Are you ready?

1395
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,376
Go get 'em, lion.

1396
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,543
Are you holding up alright?

1397
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:15,959
Yeah.

1398
01:31:55,959 --> 01:31:56,709
Get ready.

1399
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:57,751
Okay.

1400
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:15,144
That's amazing!

1401
01:32:15,168 --> 01:32:16,459
There was a hiccup,

1402
01:32:16,626 --> 01:32:18,727
but they saved themselves from it!

1403
01:32:18,751 --> 01:32:20,144
Fascinating!

1404
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:21,310
Despite the imperfection,

1405
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:23,685
their performance
showcased extreme vividness!

1406
01:32:23,709 --> 01:32:26,126
Let's see how the judges
are going to score them.

1407
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,126
Alright, Gyun.

1408
01:32:29,334 --> 01:32:31,144
All we have to do now

1409
01:32:31,168 --> 01:32:32,334
is jump over there steadily.

1410
01:32:43,918 --> 01:32:44,918
For some reason,

1411
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:46,834
he's staring at the Sky's Pillar.

1412
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:50,334
Is he wanting to challenge jumping onto it?

1413
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:54,769
However, the judges

1414
01:32:54,793 --> 01:32:56,334
told me just now.

1415
01:32:56,376 --> 01:32:57,228
It's impossible to make
it to the Sky's Pillar.

1416
01:32:57,252 --> 01:32:59,001
Don't be silly, Gyun.

1417
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:01,084
The purpose of the Sky's Pillar

1418
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:03,501
is to remind the contestants that

1419
01:33:03,918 --> 01:33:06,043
there is always a taller mountain out there

1420
01:33:06,126 --> 01:33:09,501
and there will always be miracles that
they can't achieve.

1421
01:33:17,751 --> 01:33:18,751
Kat.

1422
01:33:19,459 --> 01:33:21,043
Do you believe in miracles?

1423
01:33:23,334 --> 01:33:24,376
Only one person

1424
01:33:24,918 --> 01:33:26,293
can make it there.

1425
01:33:27,043 --> 01:33:28,251
Will you

1426
01:33:28,626 --> 01:33:29,626
give me a hand?

1427
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:51,626
What the...

1428
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:36,477
Dad, what is going on there?

1429
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:37,501
That's lion dancing.

1430
01:35:37,918 --> 01:35:39,501
What is that?

1431
01:35:40,418 --> 01:35:41,477
Our ancestors

1432
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:42,918
were fearful of the Nian Beast.

1433
01:35:43,168 --> 01:35:45,935
So they put on a charming lion head

1434
01:35:45,959 --> 01:35:47,418
to repel the beast

1435
01:35:47,584 --> 01:35:48,644
and dispel

1436
01:35:48,668 --> 01:35:51,459
the fear among us.

1437
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:52,876
Alright.

1438
01:35:53,168 --> 01:35:54,168
Take a look!

1439
01:36:41,293 --> 01:36:46,269
How to go up

1440
01:36:46,293 --> 01:36:48,626
How to go down

1441
01:36:52,251 --> 01:36:56,227
Praying to a deity is useless

1442
01:36:56,251 --> 01:36:59,501
You have a hard life,
but you're melodramatic

1443
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:09,918
I, Gyun, will bring honor to my family

1444
01:37:11,709 --> 01:37:13,126
Well, now

1445
01:37:13,543 --> 01:37:18,959
being looked down on,
unable to let go, and broke

1446
01:37:20,459 --> 01:37:25,644
Don't you worry,
I'll do great things in the future

1447
01:37:25,668 --> 01:37:29,668
My family will surely be better off someday

1448
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:42,727
The audience is going wild!

1449
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:46,543
He created a miracle!

1450
01:38:08,876 --> 01:38:11,227
What? Don't belittle me

1451
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:13,852
Only the incompetent blame society

1452
01:38:13,876 --> 01:38:16,810
And you said you want to go out there?
What do you wanna do?

1453
01:38:16,834 --> 01:38:19,560
Hey, don't you laugh at me

1454
01:38:19,584 --> 01:38:21,894
Bro, don't you belittle me

1455
01:38:21,918 --> 01:38:24,602
All my bros will make it out there

1456
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:27,560
Don't look down on us

1457
01:38:27,584 --> 01:38:30,918
Even if we can only afford a tricycle now

1458
01:38:51,584 --> 01:38:54,227
Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom

1459
01:38:54,251 --> 01:38:56,894
There are always ups and downs in life

1460
01:38:56,918 --> 01:38:59,602
Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom

1461
01:38:59,626 --> 01:39:02,227
There are always ups and downs in life

1462
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:05,019
Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom

1463
01:39:05,043 --> 01:39:07,560
There are always ups and downs in life

1464
01:39:07,584 --> 01:39:10,185
Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom

1465
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:12,935
There are always ups and downs in life

1466
01:39:12,959 --> 01:39:15,560
Ah, how to go up

1467
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:18,269
Ah, how to go down

1468
01:39:18,293 --> 01:39:20,935
Ah, how to go up

1469
01:39:20,959 --> 01:39:23,560
Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom.
Come take a look

1470
01:39:23,584 --> 01:39:26,310
Ah, how to go up

1471
01:39:26,334 --> 01:39:28,852
Ah, how to go down

1472
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:31,519
Ah, how to go up

1473
01:39:31,543 --> 01:39:34,793
Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom.
Come take a look

1474
01:40:12,793 --> 01:40:17,209
I'm a nameless person on the road

1475
01:40:19,959 --> 01:40:24,001
I have no story and no one talks about me

1476
01:40:27,084 --> 01:40:29,519
I'll give everything I have

1477
01:40:29,543 --> 01:40:32,584
So I can lead a normal life

1478
01:40:34,001 --> 01:40:38,626
Dying to live a life only to survive

1479
01:40:40,793 --> 01:40:45,376
I'm a person who left home

1480
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:52,668
A person who earns their bread in tears

1481
01:40:55,459 --> 01:40:57,793
A person who is on the road

1482
01:40:58,043 --> 01:41:01,418
A person who is providing for the family

1483
01:41:02,626 --> 01:41:07,043
And a silent noise in
the background of a city

1484
01:41:09,876 --> 01:41:12,644
I just want to feel

1485
01:41:12,668 --> 01:41:15,727
Every moment I struggle

1486
01:41:15,751 --> 01:41:21,501
Are all the wet footprints
I left behind worth it?

1487
01:41:24,043 --> 01:41:26,810
If you also get choked up

1488
01:41:26,834 --> 01:41:29,977
Then you're a friend on the same path as me

1489
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:38,001
To all the ordinary
people who are indomitable

1490
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:41,894
Cheers to the nameless

1491
01:41:41,918 --> 01:41:45,644
Cheers to your silence and roars

1492
01:41:45,668 --> 01:41:49,227
Cheers to your suffering
while walking to the top

1493
01:41:49,251 --> 01:41:52,810
Living and surviving
with your head under the horizon

1494
01:41:52,834 --> 01:41:55,519
You came from a southern village

1495
01:41:55,543 --> 01:41:58,644
Raised by a pair of rough hands

1496
01:41:58,668 --> 01:42:01,810
You're standing between buildings

1497
01:42:01,834 --> 01:42:05,293
But you don't back away

1498
01:42:07,209 --> 01:42:09,810
I came from the Spring in the North

1499
01:42:09,834 --> 01:42:12,977
Looking back one step at a time

1500
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:16,144
Behind me is the intersection
where I said goodbye to home

1501
01:42:16,168 --> 01:42:19,709
And the warmth during every sunset

1502
01:42:20,043 --> 01:42:22,227
When my hometown enters winter

1503
01:42:22,251 --> 01:42:24,185
When the train arrives to the station

1504
01:42:24,209 --> 01:42:27,185
The breeze of my childhood blows again

1505
01:42:27,209 --> 01:42:29,352
As I reminisce over the joy of innocence

1506
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,352
On the familiar streets

1507
01:42:31,376 --> 01:42:34,269
Someone will say out loud

1508
01:42:34,293 --> 01:42:38,019
With a voice full of tenderness

1509
01:42:38,043 --> 01:42:39,435
Your name

1510
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:42,977
Cheers to those who left home

1511
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:46,185
Cheers to your silence and roars

1512
01:42:46,209 --> 01:42:50,227
Cheers to your suffering
while walking to the top

1513
01:42:50,251 --> 01:42:53,668
Living and surviving with
your head under the horizon

1514
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:57,144
Cheers to the nameless

1515
01:42:57,168 --> 01:43:00,602
Cheers to your silence and roars

1516
01:43:00,626 --> 01:43:04,352
Cheers to your suffering
while walking to the top

1517
01:43:04,376 --> 01:43:08,019
Living and surviving with
your head under the horizon

1518
01:43:08,043 --> 01:43:15,001
Oh, we are the nameless ones

1519
01:43:22,543 --> 01:43:25,310
Oh, we are the nameless ones

1520
01:43:25,334 --> 01:43:27,043
Your ride is here

1521
01:43:29,501 --> 01:43:34,251
Don't look back if there's too much worry

1522
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:39,560
Oh, we are the nameless ones

1523
01:43:39,584 --> 01:43:41,209
Let's hit the road

1524
01:43:43,876 --> 01:43:47,334
Carry on with

1525
01:43:48,459 --> 01:43:51,709
Your dream
