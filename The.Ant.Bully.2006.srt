3
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,355
Oh, that's it! Spindle, taillight.

4
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,576
Hey. Hey!

5
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,245
-What?
-What do you mean, "what"?

6
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,706
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

7
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,585
Yeah, this is the sleeping chamber.
Go to sleep.

8
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,545
Don't make me come up there!

9
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:14,467
I'm so sorry, but I must have
the final ingredient for my potion.

10
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,344
Now, what's more important:

11
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:22,433
Me completing my life's work
for the salvation of the colony--

12
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,393
Which includes you guys.

13
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,729
--or your sleep?

14
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,482
-Sleep. I'm going with sleep.
-Yeah, the second one.

15
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,860
Well, then I shall try to be very quiet.

16
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,779
Clacktiel.

17
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,827
That's it, I'm coming up there!

18
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,080
Fire crystals.

19
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,459
At last. The final ingredient.

20
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,132
I'm on vacation.

21
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,721
-No. No, cut it out.
-Dogpile.

22
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,765
Dogpile.

23
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,604
It's the Destroyer!

24
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,195
Atomic wedgy.

25
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,573
And a clean break.

26
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,950
-Clean break. Excellent wedge.
-Yeah. All right.

27
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,786
Come on, man,
I'm running out of underwear.

28
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,289
Well, what are you gonna do about it, huh?
Nothing.

29
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:31,294
-Because I'm big and you're small.
-Yeah.

30
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:36,549
-Because he's big and you're small.
-Hey.

31
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,427
Quit repeating everything I say.

32
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,637
I was just adding emphasis, dude.

33
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,557
Man, why you gotta be hating?

34
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,742
Destroyer.

35
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,090
Zoc?

36
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,760
Water!

37
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,012
-Zoc.
-Hova, please, get to the grass.

38
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,555
It's dangerous up here.

39
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,224
But I've always wanted to see
a human up close.

40
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,727
I hear they're capable of speech, like us.

41
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,563
They are nothing like us.

42
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,322
What you gonna do about it, ants?
Nothing.

43
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,034
Because I'm big and you're small.

44
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:50,164
Away, monster, or I will use my powers
to destroy you.

45
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,963
Powers that I have yet to perfect. Run !

46
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,472
Hello.

47
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,017
We mean you no harm.

48
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,519
-Oh, great.
-Shoe!

49
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,396
Shoe!

50
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,072
-Please, go in peace.
-Look out!

51
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:31,664
-Are you all right?
-I-- I guess he didn't hear me.

52
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,583
Lucas.

53
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,086
Peanut, it's time to come inside now.

54
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,095
Peanut.

55
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,265
I think I might have gotten through
to him.

56
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,185
-What do you think?
-Destroyer.

57
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,648
Tiffany, Lucas, we're leaving now.

58
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,568
Lucas? All the numbers are on the fridge.

59
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,280
-Good one. Extended play.
-Lucas.

60
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,784
What are you doing back there?
Why didn't you answer?

61
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,412
-Are you all right, sweetie?
-I'm fine.

62
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,957
-I was just playing with my friends.
-I don't know.

63
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,794
-Maybe we shouldn't go on vacation.
-Come on, it's our big wedding anniversary.

64
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,713
We're going to Puerco Vallarta.

65
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:25,634
And I gotta spend a little quality time
with the mamacita.

66
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,804
Don't cancel your vacation
just because of me.

67
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,975
-I can solve my own problems.
-Problems? What problems?

68
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,145
Does it have anything to do with
why I can't find your underwear?

69
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,521
No!

70
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,649
Bed-wetting is nothing
to be ashamed of, Peanut.

71
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,735
What? Just stop it, Mom !

72
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,988
I don't have any problems
except for you treating me like a baby.

73
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,575
-Peanut.
-And stop calling me that.

74
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,369
Just go away and leave me alone.

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,710
I, Zoc, call upon the elements:

76
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:04,673
The wind that blows, rain that falls,
fire that burns.

77
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,053
Deliver your awesome power
and transform my potion.

78
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,971
Clacktiel.

79
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,560
That was great, sweetie.

80
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,231
I loved the smoke effects.
Didn't you, Spindle?

81
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,149
You...

82
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,193
...rock. Curse upon your children.

83
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,987
I don't think rocks have children, honey.

84
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,492
-They won't now.
-Okay. What's the matter?

85
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,953
Hova, the potion is supposed to
change color.

86
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,581
It's not changing color.
It's not changing color.

87
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,042
I call upon the elements:
Wind, rain, et cetera.

88
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,753
Transform my potion and clacktiel.

89
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,050
Clacktiel, clacktiel....

90
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,388
-Maybe you're pronouncing it wrong.
-How could I pronounce it wrong?

91
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,724
-I made it up.
-Take a break.

92
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,560
Hova, perhaps you didn't notice...

93
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,730
...but we were almost squished today,
and the colony is in shambles.

94
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,985
I am this close to finding a solution
to the human problem...

95
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,737
...and you tell me I need to--
Hova, what are you doing?

96
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,906
-Nothing, I'm not doing anything.
-No. Wait.

97
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,908
-No.
-I'm simply walking towards you.

98
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,327
-There's no reason to panic.
-Wait. Now, Hova--

99
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,955
-I'm just coming towards you.
-Wait. No. Hova. No.

100
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,416
Does it tickle?
What about when I do this?

101
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,501
Why are you laughing?
I see you laughing.

102
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,753
Don't make me clacktiel you.

103
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,091
Well, I'm glad you two have something
to laugh about.

104
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,761
-Head of Council.
-Hi.

105
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,265
How nice of you to....
It was unexpected.

106
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,101
Forgive me.
I was working on an experiment.

107
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,437
Oh, yes, I see.

108
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,191
Well, we were-- How may I be of service?

109
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,611
Zoc, attacks from the Destroyer
grow more frequent.

110
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,530
Our food supplies
are now desperately low.

111
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:56,368
The council was hoping
perhaps you might have a solution.

112
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,997
Fight back. We must stop the Destroyer.

113
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,458
But thousands of ants
would needlessly die.

114
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:06,378
Perhaps if we could communicate,
you know, just talk with the human.

115
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,132
Oh, what a great idea.
Let's have a nice chat.

116
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,594
Well, hello, Destroyer.
Gee, you look kind of tired.

117
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,263
Why don't you just rest your feet
on my girlfriend.

118
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,640
Okay, oka--

119
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,309
Sometimes you're a real stinkbug,
you know that?

120
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:25,648
Zoc, a war with the human is--
It's impossible.

121
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,277
A wizard knows no such word.

122
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,035
-Whatever.
-Bye, Tiff. Bye, Lucas.

123
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,621
I love you.

124
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,583
You kids mind your grandma.

125
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,002
Okay, goodbye. Have fun.

126
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,381
Don't worry, everything's under control.

127
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,638
A little help, please.

128
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,391
I think it's your turn.

129
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,518
Teeth in the grass.

130
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,940
Mommo, here's your--
What are you doing?

131
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,194
Preventing alien abduction,
that's what I'm doing.

132
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,363
Thank you.

133
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,284
Dang crabgrass.

134
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,871
See these? Airflow. Aliens hate airflow.

135
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,252
Drives them nuts. And if they try to cut
the power in the middle of the night...

136
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,965
...these babies will wake me up.

137
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,303
-We gotta be prepared. Tell your friends.
-I don't have any friends.

138
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,930
Well, who's gonna look out for you
when you get old...

139
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,101
...and your teeth are falling out,
and them aliens are after you?

140
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,896
-Lucas.
-I'll look after myself.

141
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,484
-Good night, Mommo.
-Good night. Sleep tight.

142
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,695
Don't let the bedbugs bite...

143
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,073
...or creep into your ear
and lay eggs in your brain.

144
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,425
-Dance, Pukas.
-Dance, monkey boy, dance!

145
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,761
Think fast.

146
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,368
Clacktiel.

147
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,414
You....

148
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,250
Zoc, please, not in front of Spindle.

149
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,212
Sorry.

150
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,966
God, there must be something I missed.

151
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,302
Wait. A crack.

152
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,555
That's it. Imperfections in the crystals.

153
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,642
Perhaps coating it
in a viscous compound.

154
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,769
Spindle. Resin.

155
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,487
Clacktiel.

156
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:28,497
Oh, that's it. It worked !
The potion is complete!

157
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,794
Praise the Mother! Yes! Yes! Yes!

158
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,379
No!

159
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,342
-Zoc.
-Hova, hang on.

160
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,304
Spindle, get the potion. Quickly.

161
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,420
Hello.

162
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:23,218
Yep, I was about your age
when I flooded my first colony.

163
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,973
Brother, those were good times.
Good times!

164
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,394
-Who are you?
-Stan Beals is the name.

165
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,229
Beals-A-Bug Pest Control.

166
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,525
Exterminator, eradicator,
solver of problems.

167
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,403
Hey, you must be the Nickle boy, right?

168
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,572
Now, your dad ordered my services...

169
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,408
...but he forgot to sign the contract
before he left.

170
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,536
Busy man. Lot on his mind. It happens.

171
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,748
So he just told me to talk to you....

172
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,918
-Lucas.
-Yeah, Lucas.

173
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,838
He said, "You have my son, Lucas,
sign the contract for me...

174
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,051
...if I happen to forget to before I leave.
He's a grown man now."

175
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,220
His exact words.

176
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,265
I don't know.
Do you have any references?

177
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,851
References?

178
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,770
There's one.

179
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,941
I don't think I should.

180
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,154
You don't think you should, huh?
You don't think?

181
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,866
So who does your thinking for you?
Your mommy?

182
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,494
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
what do I do?

183
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,539
I'm just a little baby
that can't think for myself.

184
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,457
Please wipe my little bottom for me.

185
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,753
Wipe me. Oh, oh, please, wipe me.

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,967
-Give me that stupid contract.
-Yes, sir. A very mature decision.

187
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,553
Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free

188
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,765
Just sign right here
And leave the killing to me

189
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,850
I wrote that.

190
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,909
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

191
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,121
Spindle? Spindle?

192
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,458
Spindle. You saved it.

193
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,794
Oh, well, come here.

194
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,964
Well, someone's getting
an extra moldy root tonight.

195
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,258
-Okay, okay.
-Zoc.

196
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,346
Spindle, light.

197
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,523
-Mother, help us.
-Oh, no.

198
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,444
To attack without provocation,
without reason...

199
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,823
...just because they can, it's--
It's barbaric.

200
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,993
But what can we do?

201
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,704
We are lost.

202
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,207
No. We are saved.

203
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,544
This is our salvation.

204
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,838
A potion?

205
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,551
What exactly does it do?

206
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,811
Hey. Hey, hey.

207
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,625
Human. Come with us.

208
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,633
Shoo. Shoo. Get away. Get away.

209
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,928
I got a fan. I'm windy.

210
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,598
I am windy.

211
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,437
Hello?

212
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,481
Hello?

213
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,277
Hello?

214
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:38,033
Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.

215
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,827
Stop! Hey, come on ! Cut it out!

216
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,539
What are you doing out of bed,
tiny Lucas?

217
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,053
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

218
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,917
Gross. Hey, cut it out.

219
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,937
Put me down ! Hey. Stop. Put me down.

220
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,277
Put me down !

221
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,909
What is that? Oh, he smells.

222
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,454
-It's the human.
-It's Peanut, the Destroyer.

223
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,625
Oh, my.

224
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,920
-All right, Peanut, this way.
-It's small.

225
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,463
-What is it?
-Touch it.

226
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,631
-Don't touch it.
-Hey.

227
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,759
-Poke it.
-He's so soft.

228
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:24,306
-His skeleton is on the inside.
-He's inside out?

229
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,899
Where are you taking me? Help!

230
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,820
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

231
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,824
Human...

232
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,578
...you have been brought
before the council...

233
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,540
...to face judgment
for crimes against the colony.

234
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,000
Read the charges.

235
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,086
"This human-destructor beast...

236
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,590
...hereafter referred to
as Peanut the Destroyer...

237
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,468
...did willfully
and with malice aforethought...

238
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,304
...crush the food-storage chambers...

239
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,848
...flood all of the lower
hatching chambers...

240
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:12,646
...and douse the colony
with the dreaded yellow rain."

241
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,856
Hey, come on, I had to go.

242
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,486
Sentencing of the human
will be handed down...

243
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,322
...by the queen herself.

244
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:35,126
Greetings, my children...

245
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,673
...and to our unusual guest...

246
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,095
...a human that threatens
the very existence of our colony.

247
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,223
Wait a second ! Wait, wait, wait.
Time out.

248
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:52,644
How was I supposed to know
ants had feelings or families or trials?

249
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,564
-You're just a bunch of stupid ants.
-Destroy the Destroyer!

250
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,317
-Throw him in the pit.
-Let's eat him !

251
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,238
No, wait. We are not mindless savages.

252
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,532
This human should be studied.

253
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,283
-And then we'll eat him.
-Yeah.

254
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,495
Eat! Eat! Eat!

255
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,498
Order. Order.

256
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,084
Be still, be still.

257
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,879
Tonight we have a choice.

258
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:25,427
We could destroy this human
and make safe this day.

259
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:30,390
Or we could change
the nature of this human...

260
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:36,229
...and perhaps create
a brighter future for all ants.

261
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:41,484
I therefore sentence the human
to live and work in the colony...

262
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:46,781
...to learn our ways.
He must become an ant.

263
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,910
-What?
-No. No, my queen.

264
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,457
What if he does not become an ant?

265
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,959
Okay, I mean, come on.

266
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,962
That would be regrettable.

267
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,966
But-- But who will teach him our ways?

268
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,595
-I will.
-Hova?

269
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,221
It is done.

270
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,475
Let us continue our work.

271
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,228
That's it?
How long am I gonna be like this?

272
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,646
I wanna go home.

273
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,607
Wait. This is inhuman.

274
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,235
Yes, it is.

275
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,324
Hello, Peanut?

276
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,160
Destroyer?

277
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,913
Hello? We have to go.

278
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,999
It's time to start your training.

279
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,835
Where are you?

280
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,466
Okay, okay. It's simple.

281
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,677
All I have to do is run past the guards,
then escape the anthill...

282
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,847
-...and not get eaten by anything.
-Well, hello there.

283
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,350
You know, there's a million things
I wanna ask you.

284
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,520
When were you hatched?
Are you--? Are you male or female?

285
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,688
And how do you tell the difference?

286
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,691
Is it--? Oh, is that how?

287
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:08,154
Hey, stop peeking.
Or-- Or I'll stomp on you.

288
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:12,075
Well, I wouldn't if I were you.
You see, I'm the only friend you've got.

289
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,368
You're gonna eat me.

290
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,038
You know, now that you mention it,
you do look soft and chewy...

291
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,666
...but I promised the queen I wouldn't.

292
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,335
Cross your heart.

293
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,129
What? Oh, all right.

294
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,297
Cross my heart, I will not eat you.

295
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,217
I said, cross your heart, not your butt.

296
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,219
I just did.

297
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,596
See, there, did it again.

298
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,014
Strange custom.

299
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,891
I'm still not going.

300
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,978
-Peanut, you need to--
-My name's Lucas, not Peanut.

301
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,896
Lucas.

302
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,066
Well, Lucas. You heard the queen.

303
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,944
You must become an ant
if you ever want to return home.

304
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,071
And how am I supposed to do that?

305
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,740
Well, you just have
to find your place in the colony.

306
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,754
So, Lucas,
do you have any special skills?

307
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,424
I can make milk come out
of my sister's nose.

308
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:13,386
Okay, well, let's try foraging.

309
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,555
The instructor
is a personal friend of mine.

310
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,849
I'm sure she'd love to help.

311
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,226
Peanut? The Destroyer?

312
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,520
I had to move out
of my nest because of you.

313
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,272
I lost everything.

314
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,733
Took me all morning to rebuild.

315
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:31,571
Hova, don't tell me
that you are mentoring this-- This-- This....

316
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,865
It's Lucas.

317
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,204
Why is he covered in trash? Is he crazy?
Because I don't teach crazy ants.

318
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,916
No, no, no. He calls the trash "clothes."

319
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,126
They like keeping
their gender traits hidden.

320
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,962
He's male.

321
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,883
Okay, Lucas, you're on the blue team.

322
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,718
-Oh, man. That's not fair.
-Come on.

323
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,929
Hey, hey, hey, quiet.

324
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,723
And suck in that thorax.

325
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:03,228
Like everything in the colony,
foraging is a team effort.

326
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:09,442
In this test, each team must act
as a single unit to avoid obstacles...

327
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,321
...retrieve the sweet rock
and return to the nest.

328
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,574
No ant gets left behind.

329
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,326
First team back wins.

330
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,495
Any questions?

331
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,168
-Hello, baby.
-Fugax.

332
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:31,339
Well, isn't it true that scout ants,
such as myself...

333
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,969
...lead an exciting life of adventure
and intrigue.

334
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,931
-Fugax!
-While foragers, such as you...

335
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,309
...just walk around and pick up sticks.

336
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,938
Questions, anyone?

337
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,274
-Oh, sir?
-The guy with the crooked mandibles.

338
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,984
What kind of adventures?

339
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,528
Well, I'm glad you asked.

340
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:57,073
-Fugax.
-Gather round, young scouts.

341
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:02,787
In my travels, I have journeyed
far beyond the great flat rock.

342
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,873
You mean, the street?

343
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,168
No. The great flat rock...

344
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:14,382
...where the humans
ride in their giant metal cocoons.

345
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,050
Cars.

346
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,177
Did I call on you?

347
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,596
Who invited Captain Party Pooper?

348
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,640
Fugax, meet the Destroyer.

349
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,225
Destroyer?

350
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,485
Now, are there any other--?

351
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:40,033
Are there any other questions
about your assignment?

352
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,077
Yeah, what's a sweet rock?

353
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,746
Go.

354
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,962
-Bridge.
-Stack up.

355
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,589
Bridge, hooyah.

356
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,965
Come on, Peanut.

357
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,260
Hello, I can do it myself.

358
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,516
Hey, guys. I think he's dead.

359
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,061
I'm not dead.

360
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,855
-Ladder.
-Ladder, hooyah.

361
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,608
-Come on.
-Grab hold.

362
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,735
I don't need your help.

363
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,945
I need your help! I need your help!

364
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,323
Bye, losers.

365
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,658
Come on.

366
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,997
-All right.
-Hurry, human.

367
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,374
You're gonna make us lose.

368
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,793
Hey. I've only got two legs.

369
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,129
Go, Two Legs, go.

370
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,589
Go, Lucas.

371
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,050
-Spring.
-Spring, hooyah.

372
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,135
Hooyah.

373
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,639
Oh, time out.

374
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,724
I don't think I can do this--

375
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,059
All right.

376
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,398
-Let me off!
-Don't let go!

377
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:55,483
I'm gonna be sick.

378
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,276
Don't let go.

379
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,612
-I'm letting go.
-Don't let go.

380
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:03,825
He let go.

381
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,875
-A jellybean?
-All right, Lucas.

382
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,794
Good thinking.

383
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,338
Slingshot, hooyah.

384
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,266
-All right, Lucas. Good job.
-Yeah, Peanut, you rule.

385
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,519
-Come on, we're losing. Let's go.
-Good job, Lucas.

386
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,312
-Did we win yet?
-Almost.

387
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,399
We just have to get the sweet rock
over the finish line.

388
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,775
Come on, let's go.

389
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,487
Hurry up, Peanut.

390
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,615
Yeah, right.

391
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,701
Hurry, Lucas, climb the wall.

392
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,119
Climb fast, Peanut.

393
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,537
They're catching up.

394
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,539
Bye-bye, loser.

395
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,291
Climb the wall.

396
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,294
Come on. Climb the wall.

397
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,087
Come on.

398
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,048
Forget it. This game is rigged.

399
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,217
-Ladder.
-Hooyah.

400
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,346
Come on. Let's go. Go, go, go.

401
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,474
We got it. We go it. Yeah, man. All right.

402
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,058
Red rules.

403
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,896
Red team wins.

404
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,107
All right. We did it.

405
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,820
Thanks for trying.

406
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,584
Lucas, you did fine, really.

407
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,212
You just need to discover the ant within.

408
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,756
Start by visualizing yourself with six legs.

409
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:44,008
-Then, if you--
-How's that gonna get me home?

410
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,677
Look at me. I'm not a stupid ant.

411
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,681
Lucas, being an ant means more
than just having six legs or--

412
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,227
Or lifting 10 times your own weight
or walking vertically up a wall...

413
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,939
...it's being part of a colony.
Not always thinking of yourself first.

414
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,399
-Oh, careful.
-Hey, don't touch me.

415
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,610
I'm trying to help you.

416
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,153
You think this is easy for me?

417
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,572
Being the Destroyer's little helper?

418
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,618
So you worry about you,
and I'll worry about me.

419
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,662
Oh, Lucas.

420
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,455
That's not the way ants are.

421
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,875
Oh, Hova, that's the way I am.

422
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,795
Well, if I could just--

423
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,798
Just what?

424
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,385
Hello? Earth to ant lady.

425
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,887
You were in the middle
of sounding like my mom.

426
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,765
They're coming. Run !

427
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,810
Hey. Hey! What's wrong?

428
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,569
-They're after the herd.
-What herd?

429
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,447
Whoa, easy, girl.

430
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,324
Easy.

431
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,495
Take cover.

432
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,125
Tell the queen I love her.

433
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,253
Oh, we're cut off.

434
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:10,386
Come, brothers, for queen and colony.

435
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,146
Get to the grass.

436
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,023
Attack formation.

437
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,191
Load them up.

438
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,697
-Enemy fire.
-Watch your wing. Watch your wing.

439
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,033
-Now, that's gotta sting.
-Nice shot.

440
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,036
My turn.

441
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,330
-Thanks.
-Where's Hova?

442
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,206
I don't know.

443
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,000
Come on.

444
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,003
To your positions. Ready.

445
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,506
Squirt.

446
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,060
Don't.
Please, I was just following orders.

447
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,687
Who wants magic?

448
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,564
Clacktiel.

449
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,071
You look tasty.

450
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,656
Leave him alone.

451
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,827
Hova? Oh, quick, get out of my way.

452
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,162
Move.

453
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,706
-Hova.
-Hurry.

454
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,249
Everyone, into the grass.

455
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,835
Don't just stand there. Help her.

456
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,630
Lucas, run.

457
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:29,006
What are you doing?

458
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,054
Everyone, into the grass.

459
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,706
Where are you...

460
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,791
...little bug?

461
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,605
Please, hurry up. Light, light.

462
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,444
Light, light.

463
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,122
Hova, get down.

464
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,833
Zoc.

465
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,048
No!

466
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,010
Stop, hey! No, no.

467
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,354
Fire in the hole!

468
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,616
-What was that?
-It's bath time.

469
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:19,867
Retreat.

470
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,047
They're leaving.

471
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,507
We-- We won.

472
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,471
All hail the Destroyer.

473
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,056
Peanut! Peanut!

474
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,682
Brilliant. Genius.

475
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,351
I mean, Lucas made a:

476
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,978
And then...they all flew away.

477
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,397
And now I know
why they call you Peanut.

478
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,901
He's got a brain the size of a peanut.

479
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,736
Lucas the Destroyer.

480
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,823
I take back everything
I thought about you.

481
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,533
You saved us.

482
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,993
Thank you, Lucas.

483
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,913
Yeah, sure.

484
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,999
He saved us.

485
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,045
Oh, it's so obvious, I was so dumb.

486
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,756
Praise the Destroyer.

487
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,259
Wake up. He saved himself.

488
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,427
The rest of us just--

489
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,556
Just got in the way.

490
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,183
Zoc. Oh, are you all right?

491
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,810
-No, I'm--
-What happened to you?

492
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,520
I'm fine. I'm fine.

493
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,939
-You're hurt.
-No, it's nothing, really, I just--

494
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,941
Zoc, do you have any yucca sap?

495
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,361
Lucas has a burn. Poor baby.

496
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,115
This is our enemy.

497
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,077
They do not save ants, they kill ants.

498
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,705
He very nearly killed me.

499
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,875
Or does that not matter to you?

500
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,929
I do, you do
We all like the honeydew

501
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,598
Dinner is served.

502
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,224
And I'm the dessert.

503
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,977
And I'm on a low-fathead diet.

504
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,479
And you know, it looks good on you.

505
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,398
So, Lucas, what are you working on?

506
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,566
Glasses.

507
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,905
This is some good honeydew.

508
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:26,327
Oh, Lucas, you have to try some.
It's so good.

509
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,246
Go ahead.

510
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,003
This is awesome.

511
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,672
Tastes like green-apple bubble gum.

512
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,681
That went away quick.
Another round for you?

513
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,350
Oh, yeah, keep it coming.

514
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,534
Get it while it's hot.

515
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,623
Whoa, I didn't know
humans could change their colors.

516
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,667
-Trippy.
-Perhaps our young pupa...

517
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,252
...ate too much honeydew.

518
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,968
Here, eat this.

519
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,511
It'll make you feel better.

520
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,014
What did that come out of?

521
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,933
It's an alka root.

522
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:35,145
Zoc discovered its powers to expel evil
and create well-being.

523
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,399
He is a great wizard.

524
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,567
Yeah, he hates me.

525
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,277
Whoa, he really does, doesn't he?

526
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,154
I mean, he hates your guts.

527
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,032
It's actually amazing
how much he hates your guts.

528
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,450
Okay, I'm sorry.

529
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:52,454
Yes, Zoc has anger issues,
especially towards humans...

530
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,081
...but he's a true ant.

531
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,543
Hard on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

532
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,421
Just give him time, Lucas.

533
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,190
Praise the Mother.

534
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,444
Praise the Mother.

535
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,447
Thanks.

536
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,116
Who is this mother
you keep talking about, anyway?

537
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,367
Is it the queen?

538
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,786
No, Lucas, the Ant Mother.

539
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,788
The queen of queens.

540
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,791
She gave birth to the first colony.

541
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,669
To all ants.

542
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:44,298
Come on. It's time for you to see.

543
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:03,817
This is the Chamber of the Ages.

544
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,655
What are these?

545
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,534
They tell the story
of our colony, our history.

546
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,995
These are pretty cool.

547
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,760
This is the image of the Ant Mother.

548
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,808
It is said that one day she will return...

549
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,853
...and honeydew will pour
from the sky like rain.

550
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,357
Then we will never go hungry again.

551
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,193
So you actually want warm poop
to fall from the sky?

552
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:50,030
Yes. That would be a blessed day.

553
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,367
I'm sorry, it's just so beautiful.

554
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,453
Hey, what's that one?

555
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,330
It's the evil one.

556
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,958
The Cloudbreather.

557
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,419
It is ancient, drawn before our time.

558
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:10,008
No one knows for sure what it is,
except that death is said to follow it.

559
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,387
I think it's just a story used
to scare naughty pupas into behaving.

560
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:17,391
No, the exterminator.

561
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,892
I-- I gotta cancel him.

562
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,477
I gotta go home now.

563
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,020
But you're not an ant yet.

564
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,398
-Just a quick visit.
-No way, Two Legs.

565
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,567
The humans' nest is strictly forbidden.

566
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,069
Well...

567
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,989
...the colony needs food, right?

568
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,699
Food?

569
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,660
Yeah, sweet rocks.
My house is filled with them.

570
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,289
-In assorted colors and flavors.
-Assorted flavors?

571
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,748
Even the greenies?

572
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,418
Well, you'll be needing a scout.

573
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,503
No. There is no way
you're gonna get me--

574
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,173
-I'm in.
-Come on.

575
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,551
Better be some red ones.

576
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,307
Wow, this is a big nest.

577
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,268
Must have taken thousands
of humans to build this.

578
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,604
-What's that?
-It's just the door.

579
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,273
A door? Fantastic.

580
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,942
Do all of your guests
pass under this door?

581
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,946
Well, actually, you guys
are the first friends I've had over.

582
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,823
We are the first ones?

583
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,743
Kreela, we're the first ones
to pass under the door.

584
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:20,037
-Great.
-And to think...

585
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,624
...all of this is made from your own poop.

586
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,125
Nice.

587
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,796
Oh, why did Mom
have to get shag carpet?

588
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,716
It'll take days to get to the kitchen.

589
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,386
Oh, gee, that is too bad.

590
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,349
I guess now we'll have to go home
before we all get in trouble.

591
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,144
No.

592
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,980
Wait.

593
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,486
Come on.

594
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,488
This is called hang-gliding.

595
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,992
Have you ever done this, actually?

596
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,369
I played the video game.

597
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,080
Now, when I give the word,
everybody jump.

598
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,835
Now.

599
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,174
Oh, sorry, was that the word?

600
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,510
-Coming.
-Hey, hey, look out.

601
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,680
For queen and colony.

602
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,932
Oh, God.

603
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:31,566
-Showoff.
-Awesome. Yeah.

604
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,779
This is Hawaii.
We went there last summer.

605
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,283
It's got volcanoes and hula dancers
and Don Ho and surfboards.

606
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,034
And I caught a fish.

607
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,122
And these are the pyramids.
Well, not the real pyramids.

608
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,125
The real ones are lots bigger.
Mommo says aliens built them.

609
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:49,626
She's my grandma.

610
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,138
Oh, are these your nest mates?

611
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,016
Yeah, that's my family.

612
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,309
Which one's the queen?

613
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,186
My sister thinks she is.

614
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,522
What's wrong?

615
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,859
Nothing. It's just, well....

616
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,238
I should have told
my mom goodbye. That's all.

617
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,742
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

618
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,037
-Lucas, your face is leaking.
-Leaking?

619
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,081
Oh, no, it's okay.

620
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,500
Is that what humans do
when they're sad?

621
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,169
They leak from the face?

622
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:36,298
When ants are sad, we do this:

623
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,112
Oh, Lucas, it's-- It's--

624
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,281
It's beautiful !

625
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,285
Sweet rocks, come to papa!

626
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,096
Red one.

627
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,890
What are you doing?
Why aren't you taking the red ones?

628
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,227
Well, it's actually
quite simple, sugar lips.

629
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,812
I hate the red ones.

630
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,064
Well, I love the red ones.

631
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,732
-Hate them.
-I love them !

632
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,609
-Hate, hate, hate.
-Love. Love.

633
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,612
-Admit it, you find me attractive.
-What?

634
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,490
Oh, how you tease me
with your sweet talk.

635
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,951
Oh, you want some sweet talk?

636
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,370
Because I'll give you some sweet talk.

637
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,997
Now grab a red one
before I pull these off.

638
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,749
Whoa, I need those.

639
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,169
What are we doing?

640
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,171
Nothing, nothing.

641
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,153
-Mommo, I'm back!
-What was that?

642
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,281
-Tiffany.
-What's a Tiffany?

643
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,866
-Hurry up!
-Right.

644
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,701
Leave the red ones behind !

645
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:29,619
Fugax!

646
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,874
Hey, pipsqueak, you there?

647
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,792
Hello?

648
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,711
Crossfire!

649
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:42,048
That kid and his stupid electronic toys.

650
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,679
What is he doing?

651
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,140
Jumping. You know,
hippity hop, uppity downy?

652
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,309
It's a scout thing.
You wouldn't understand.

653
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,603
Okay, come on. One more.

654
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,812
I just need a seven.

655
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,028
-Hello. How are you?
-Hi.

656
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:05,113
Pizza Kingdom. Hail to the king.

657
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:09,075
Would you like to try our new
Princess Pepperoni with tangy Jester Sauce?

658
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,620
Hello! This is Lucas Nickle!

659
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,914
I need to cancel my order!

660
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,876
What?

661
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,377
You don't want to order?

662
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,840
Please cancel the contract!

663
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:28,762
-No exterminator!
-No extra tomato. Got it.

664
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,807
Yes. No exterminator.

665
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,935
I'm canceling the contract.

666
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,063
What? You-- You wanna cancel?

667
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:39,231
Who is this?

668
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,274
Oh, Bill, is this you, man?

669
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:44,611
You got me, man. You got me, dude.

670
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:47,739
That's a relief.

671
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:51,451
Okay, Lucas, I don't understand
most of what just happened.

672
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,078
What is an exterminator?

673
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:57,123
Oh, don't worry. Everything's okay now.

674
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,216
Hide!

675
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,347
This is Tiff. Hi, Mom.

676
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,767
Yeah, everything's fine.
Lucas is being a pest.

677
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:18,770
He's in his room playing...

678
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,647
-...those stupid video games.
-No, no!

679
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,775
I will. I will. Okay, Mom.

680
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:29,281
Yes. I'm hugging the phone too. Bye.

681
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:36,955
You must be Queen Tiffany.

682
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,665
Allow me to introduce--

683
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,013
Remember your training.

684
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,475
Oh, no. No, no, no! Mother!

685
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:03,189
We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

686
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,025
Hello?

687
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,486
Tiffany, no! You'll squish Lucas.

688
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,947
Hello. Nobody's shrunk.
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

689
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,365
What are you talking about?

690
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,285
Lucas! You let him go. It's me you want.

691
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:21,207
Come back. Probe me instead. Lucas!

692
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,088
Bring back Lucas, you alien scum !

693
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,257
Oh, Lucas. Lucas.

694
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,842
-Okay, Mommo.
-Lucas.

695
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,220
Let's go find your other teeth.

696
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,284
Hova, where are you?

697
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:11,549
Hova? Hova! Are you all right?

698
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,427
Are we all right? Of course.
Why wouldn't we be?

699
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,514
We're fine. We're all right. Silly.

700
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,308
Whoa, whoa, wait.
No, wait, now, hold up.

701
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,644
Zoc! Zoc, guess what we did?

702
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,938
We went to Hawaii.
We saw the pyramids.

703
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,481
We flew without wings.

704
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,274
At first, it was like:

705
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,943
But then it was:

706
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:33,446
Of course, the others were terrified,
so I took charge. And then we....

707
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,074
We were inside the humans' nest.

708
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,285
Humans' nest? That's forbidden !

709
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,537
Right, right.

710
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,540
But the nest was filled
with sweet rocks, okay.

711
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,208
Lots of them.

712
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:49,462
But then Queen Tiffany started swatting,
some massive flying teeth attacked us...

713
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,424
...and, well, here we are.
What a day. Good night.

714
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:56,052
And who told you
about these sweet rocks?

715
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,472
-Lucas, of course.
-Really?

716
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,102
Hi, there. How are you?

717
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,481
-Okay.
-Okay. That's good.

718
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,442
It's good to be okay.

719
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:15,321
Listen, I just wanted
to show you something, if that's okay.

720
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,366
You know what this is?

721
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,495
This is the potion that will
make you big again.

722
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,666
I just wanted you to take
a good, long look at it.

723
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,919
Because this is the last time
you will ever see it.

724
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,589
What do you mean?

725
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:37,010
I mean, there is no way I am ever
going to make you big again.

726
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:43,725
Ever. You are a threat
to every ant in this colony.

727
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:45,852
Especially to Hova.

728
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,438
But I would never do anything
to hurt Hova.

729
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,691
I just-- I--

730
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,860
I just wanna go home.

731
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,612
Well, then, if I were you...

732
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:01,075
...I'd try to find help somewhere else,
because there is nothing for you here.

733
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:04,788
Nothing.

734
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,718
The pain, the pain ! It's unbearable.

735
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,386
Just put me out of my misery!

736
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,222
Oh, hold still, you big pupa.

737
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,724
I haven't even touched you yet.

738
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,852
Be gentle with me.

739
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,572
-Where's Lucas?
-Isn't he with you?

740
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:44,994
-No.
-Lucas? Lucas? That's weird.

741
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,748
Well, he's probably off destroying
some other poor, unfortunate colony.

742
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,917
You know how they are. Destroyers.

743
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,002
Zoc, what have you done?

744
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,339
-Me? What did I do?
-Where is he?

745
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,924
He's gone.

746
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:01,219
-He led you into a trap, Hova.
-There was no trap.

747
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,597
He led us to food.
He was trying to protect us from....

748
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,183
-From what? What, Hova?
-From something.

749
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,810
Oh, something !

750
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:11,062
And I was worried it was from nothing.

751
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,856
He's blinded you, Hova.

752
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,275
No, you are the one who's blind.

753
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,695
You are so consumed
by your hatred for the humans...

754
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:22,115
-...you see only what you want to see.
-Oh, come on.

755
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:26,244
Zoc, I see a young pupa,
a human learning our ways...

756
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:30,123
...becoming part of this colony,
becoming an ant.

757
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,709
-Impossible.
-Listen to yourself, Zoc.

758
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:36,462
"A wizard knows no such word."
So, what are you now?

759
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,215
Certainly not the ant I love.

760
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:41,134
Hova!

761
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,970
I did it for you, for the colony.

762
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,306
You did it for yourself.

763
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,641
Hova, I....

764
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,729
He won't make it
through the night alone.

765
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,939
Fugax, your leg's broken.

766
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,442
Yeah, but I still have five good ones.

767
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,527
Very good ones.

768
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:03,239
You know, I believe he was trying
to protect us from something.

769
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,491
See you, Zoc.

770
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,141
Maybe Zoc is right.

771
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,311
Now I'll never get home.

772
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:38,441
Hi ! Nice evening, huh?

773
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,651
Oh, may I?

774
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,653
Sure, help yourself.

775
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,782
Thanks, I love water! I'm a beetle
that loves water, but I'm not a water beetle.

776
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,618
Isn't that funny? I'm a beetle--

777
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,407
Hey, Lucas.

778
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,953
Hey, anybody know what...means?

779
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,081
I think I just figured it out.

780
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,166
Croaker!

781
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,005
This way!

782
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,680
Don't ever leave me again.

783
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,182
-But Zoc told me--
-You are my pupa, not Zoc's.

784
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,271
Lucas, come on.

785
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:07,864
Climb! You can do it. Just concentrate.

786
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,783
I'm an ant. Okay, I'm an ant.

787
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,995
-He's got it. He's got it.
-Look, I'm an ant!

788
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:17,040
He hasn't got it.

789
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,799
Grab hold !

790
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,386
Hova?

791
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,432
Lucas!

792
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,657
Wow, we came right
down that guy's throat, didn't we?

793
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,534
Hey, smiley, you're on my wing.

794
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,661
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

795
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,330
So, what do you guys do?

796
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:00,500
I'm a glowworm. I glow.

797
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,876
That's great!

798
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,545
You're really starting
to irritate me. Can you--?

799
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,719
Oh, gross.

800
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,722
Will you quit eating, fatso?

801
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,849
It's cramped in here.
There's no more room !

802
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:21,771
Don't worry. I'm afraid we will be
moving along in due course.

803
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,564
Always with the negative with you.

804
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,110
Why can't you be more-- Hey, Lenny!

805
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,945
This is what I'm talking about.

806
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,406
Lenny always has a smile on his face--

807
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,953
Let me out! Let me out!

808
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,164
-I don't wanna be a toadstool !
-"A toadstool." That's great.

809
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,916
-You like that?
-That's very funny.

810
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,210
There's plenty more
where that came from, pal.

811
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,212
I like-- Hi, what's your name?

812
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,506
There he goes again.

813
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,884
Stop! Come back!

814
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,427
-Hova!
-No!

815
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,139
Hova, he's gone.

816
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,559
Croaker, over here. This way!

817
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,893
-Zoc!
-Zoc!

818
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,229
I am delicious, eat me.

819
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,565
Zoc, are you crazy?

820
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,359
-He's crazy.
-Hey, froggy!

821
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,322
No relationship is worth this.

822
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,039
Oh, sure. Why not? Come on in.

823
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,543
-Welcome to paradise.
-Zoc! How'd you get here?

824
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,920
I sure didn't come in
through the rear entrance.

825
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:30,756
Welcome. Make yourself at home. Hi.

826
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,425
Who is this? Your ant?

827
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:35,344
Zoc, you are crazy.
You're inside a frog, for Mother's sake.

828
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,346
What are you doing? This is impossible!

829
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,266
"Listen to yourself, Zoc.
A wizard knows no such word.

830
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,685
So, what are you now?"

831
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,105
Weirdo.

832
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,608
What does she see in you?

833
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,694
-What does she see in you?
-Exactly!

834
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,283
Not me.

835
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,953
-Hey, is that...?
-Alka root? So it is.

836
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,291
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my.

837
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,630
You might wanna let go of that.

838
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,633
Oh, no. So you can grab it?
I don't think so.

839
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,802
-Hands in the air.
-Oh, my.

840
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,643
Wow, that was great!

841
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,604
Hey, we sure owe you one!
Thanks a lot!

842
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:30,316
I'm free! I'm free!

843
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,111
Oh, crap.

844
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,201
Hey, Zoc, thanks. But why'd you do it?

845
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:43,829
An ant will sacrifice himself
for his friends.

846
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,250
-I thought you hated me.
-I didn't do it for you.

847
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,850
All right, well, we should
camp here for the night.

848
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,561
Come on, Fugax. Let's forage some food.

849
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,690
Excuse me? I don't forage.

850
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,234
I'll scout for food.

851
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:14,860
Right, let's go.

852
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,113
Zoc, stay with Lucas.

853
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,864
He's been through a lot today.

854
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,909
-Hova, please, don't ask me to--
-He's not what you think.

855
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,911
There is goodness in him.

856
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,831
There's an ant in him.

857
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,084
See, he really is trying.

858
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:31,961
Come on. You can do it.

859
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,382
-Concentrate.
-One, two, three.

860
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:40,803
Think ant. Ant. Ant.

861
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,223
Yeah, all right.

862
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,727
Craznocks.

863
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,279
It's funny.

864
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:01,741
The sky looks exactly the same.

865
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,327
Everything else is so different...

866
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,747
...but it's the same sky, the same stars.

867
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,043
Why must you keep doing that?

868
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:16,672
-Are you ill?
-What? Oh, you mean yawning.

869
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,176
-I'm just tired.
-Please stop. It's disgusting.

870
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:25,473
-Ants don't yawn?
-Definitely not, thank you.

871
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:31,896
So this city of yours, it's like a nest?

872
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,774
Well, yeah. Kind of.

873
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,651
And the humans that live there
are all brothers...

874
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,780
...working together
for the greatness of their colony?

875
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,282
Well, not exactly.

876
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:48,287
It's a little more like,
you know, every man for himself.

877
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,915
But that's so primitive.

878
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,625
How does anything get done?

879
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,752
Some people work together.

880
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,796
Some. Why not all?

881
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,466
I suppose it's because
of their differences.

882
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,260
But it's the differences
that make a colony strong.

883
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:07,098
Foragers, scouts, drones,
nurses, regurgitators...

884
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,518
...all are different,
but an essential part of the whole.

885
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,145
This is where we ants draw our strength.

886
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:16,607
My differences just get me beat up.

887
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:19,443
-And why is that?
-I don't know.

888
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:23,489
Some humans prefer to clobber people
they don't understand.

889
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:27,368
Like you prefer to clobber ants.

890
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,372
I guess I didn't think
about what I was doing.

891
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,999
Seems to happen a lot.

892
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:40,756
I suppose sometimes I, too,
can act without thinking.

893
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,846
Perhaps in this way, we are alike.

894
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,101
Good night, Lucas.

895
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,936
Good night, Zoc.

896
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,353
-What's the matter?
-Look!

897
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,564
-What is it? What's wrong?
-I see her!

898
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,566
-Who her?
-The Ant Mother!

899
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,985
She's come! She's here!

900
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,073
Look! Look!

901
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,371
What do you know?

902
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,916
There really is an--

903
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,253
No.

904
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,890
Cloudbreather.

905
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,643
But I cancelled the contract.

906
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,771
Praise the Mother!

907
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,773
-Praise the Mother!
-She's come at last!

908
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,527
Everyone, please, calm down.

909
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:32,284
Listen to me! It is not the Ant Mother!

910
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,788
-It is a Cloudbreather!
-It's true.

911
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,791
He's come to wipe out the entire colony.

912
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,793
How can we possibly fight back?

913
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,711
His magic is strong.

914
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:46,757
Sprayers.

915
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,927
Foggers.

916
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,971
Oh, that's the stuff.

917
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,806
Zappers.

918
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,225
Sulfur bombs.

919
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,569
And how do you know of this creature?

920
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,862
Because....

921
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:12,283
-Because I brought him here.
-Lucas!

922
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,617
I knew it. I told you.

923
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:17,538
-Guards, remove this human.
-Come on, kid.

924
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,957
-Hova!
-Lucas!

925
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,503
-No.
-Wait. The potion.

926
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:30,134
That's it! Zoc, you shrunk me.
You can shrink the Cloudbreather.

927
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,512
We can load these things up and then:

928
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,180
Right in the ear!

929
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,767
Yes. Yes, perhaps.

930
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,729
But the Cloudbreather
towers above us like a tree.

931
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,522
How do we get close enough?

932
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,190
I've got an idea.

933
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,279
Zoc, you would trust this human?

934
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,498
Yoo-hoo, hello?

935
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,667
We need to talk to you.

936
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,754
Show yourselves.

937
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:11,050
Down here. Hello?

938
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:22,519
Well, well, well.
Just in time for lunch.

939
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:24,396
-Hello.
-Wait.

940
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:27,191
Listen to me. We come in peace.

941
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:31,528
The exterminator's here. He brings
death clouds that will destroy us all...

942
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,989
...unless we can work together
to stop him.

943
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:36,950
Death clouds, huh?

944
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,662
Okay, let's eat.

945
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,248
Get behind me.

946
01:06:55,804 --> 01:07:01,266
Sir, the east nest, totally destroyed.

947
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,894
The cloud is coming.

948
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,147
The cloud !

949
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:22,788
What do you have in mind?

950
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,755
Remember, you only get one shot at it.

951
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:36,135
Don't fire until you see
the wax of his ears.

952
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,971
-Understood.
-Ready? Lucas?

953
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,474
-Good to go.
-Hey. Hey. Stop it. Stop it.

954
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:46,145
Zoc! Can I switch? Mine's broken.

955
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,064
All right, boys. Heat them up.

956
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:57,322
Let's fly.

957
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:20,012
Hey, that looks fun. Let's help, shall we?

958
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,849
Okay. I only live two weeks anyway.

959
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,351
Good for you.

960
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:38,030
First wave, attack!

961
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,663
So you want to rumble, huh?
Come on. Come on.

962
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,373
Come on !

963
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,000
I'm going in.

964
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,013
I can't get through.
He's got some kind of shield.

965
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,724
Craznocks. Headphones!

966
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:32,251
For queen and colony!

967
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:35,712
Yeah.

968
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,842
Why have you stopped?

969
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:44,513
Oh, geez. Boy, that hurts. Please stop.

970
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,181
Bye-bye.

971
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:57,067
We'll have to land on him.
Find a way in.

972
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,783
He's reloading ! Now's our chance.

973
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,415
Draw!

974
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,503
Zoc!

975
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,309
-Welcome to the scalp.
-Hello.

976
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,811
-Have a slice.
-Enjoy.

977
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,440
Fingers!

978
01:10:36,608 --> 01:10:38,692
He's scratching again !

979
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:42,237
-To the armpit!
-Dive, dive!

980
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:51,997
Leave my friends alone!

981
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,255
Don't pick your nose.
Don't pick your nose.

982
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:09,014
-Need a lift?
-Thanks.

983
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,785
No.

984
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,914
Hova, are you okay?

985
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,666
What?

986
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,044
Nighty night.

987
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,338
Run !

988
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,845
Come on, get up!
We got to go, we got to go!

989
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,722
I'm done, little ant.

990
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,731
Run ! Run !

991
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,819
Lucas, go on.

992
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:06,071
Save yourself.

993
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:22,504
That's not the way ants are.

994
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:27,217
Hurry up.

995
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,693
Lucas? Lucas!

996
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,323
Lucas!

997
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,457
You did it. You did it!

998
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,668
Now, that's an ant.

999
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,086
Oh, sorry.

1000
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,797
Thanks, kid.

1001
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,225
Oh, yeah !

1002
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:21,313
-Our weapons are useless.
-We just need a clear shot.

1003
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,944
Hey, wait. A shot.

1004
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:33,158
Okay, now what?

1005
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:37,329
Well, I don't know,
because I've never attacked before.

1006
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:39,581
-Isn't that funny?
-Hilarious.

1007
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,626
Oh, look. Here's a way in.

1008
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:49,508
Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free

1009
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:54,012
Call Beals-A-Bug
And leave the bug-killing to me

1010
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:04,356
Okay, I'm feeling like we ought to attack
something in here.

1011
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,068
Hey, that looks vulnerable.

1012
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,654
Perfect.

1013
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,828
Oh, look. Here's our way out.

1014
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,039
Let's give this human a goodbye kiss.

1015
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,460
Pucker up, Mr. Beals!

1016
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,864
No, no, no.

1017
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:56,408
Stop. Just get away from me.
Get away from me.

1018
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,458
You can't exterminate me.

1019
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:09,087
Oh, yeah. I'm Stan Beals!

1020
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,006
Oh, no, no, no!

1021
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,760
Praise the Mother!

1022
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,603
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

1023
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:37,741
This day I no longer see
a human among ants...

1024
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:41,870
...but instead a single colony.

1025
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,998
No more Lucas the Destroyer...

1026
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:48,543
...but Rokai the ant.

1027
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,299
Welcome to the colony.

1028
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:58,678
Isn't that wonderful?

1029
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,848
-Rokai?
-It's an ant name.

1030
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,475
A wizard name.

1031
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:08,313
Rokai has earned his freedom.

1032
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,983
And we have earned a friend.

1033
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,320
Remember us.

1034
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,824
Hey, Lucas--

1035
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,079
I mean, Rokai.
Listen, once you get back...

1036
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:27,958
...if you get the chance, how about
dropping a few sweet rocks now and then?

1037
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:31,294
You know, red ones, preferably.

1038
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:34,673
Red ones?
I thought you hated the red ones.

1039
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,636
Well, I do, but I'm starting to like them.

1040
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,598
I'm gonna miss you, Two Legs.

1041
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,559
Calling a human "friend."

1042
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,437
I thought that impossible until you came.

1043
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,357
But, Zoc, a wizard knows no such word.

1044
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,776
Very true.

1045
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,569
Here.

1046
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,740
But just wait until you're outside
before you drink it.

1047
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,827
I still think I should have eaten you
when I had the chance.

1048
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:05,787
I am soft and chewy.

1049
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:08,832
But I promised the queen I wouldn't.

1050
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,042
I'm gonna miss you, Hova.

1051
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,795
We're going to miss you too, Rokai.

1052
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,463
Cross our hearts.

1053
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,466
Cross our hearts!

1054
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:31,313
He's back. He's back!

1055
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:37,652
He's in his birthday suit.
Happy birthday, Lucas!

1056
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,239
Got you that time.

1057
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,916
Hi, Tiff. Is everything all right?

1058
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,335
Where's Lucas?

1059
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:57,005
Still locked in his room,
hiding from society.

1060
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,049
Mom, hey, Mom !

1061
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:02,844
-Lucas, what is it?
-I forgot to tell you goodbye.

1062
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,347
Goodbye.

1063
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:09,017
Goodbye, Peanut. Oh, sorry,
I shouldn't call you that.

1064
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,853
It's okay. I don't mind.

1065
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:15,106
Casa, sweet casa.

1066
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,151
These suitcases are muy grande,
my little love nacho.

1067
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,778
How about getting the el door-o?

1068
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,238
I don't know what you mean, honey.

1069
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,949
-Yeah, honey, the puerta, the--
-What's the puerta?

1070
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,411
-The door, the door!
-The door. Okay, I got it. I got it.

1071
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:34,125
Hey, Pukas, where you been?
We've been looking for you.

1072
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:39,756
-I think someone's overdue for a dogpile.
-Yeah, dogpile!

1073
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,132
He said dogpile.

1074
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:45,804
Stop saying everything I say, got it?

1075
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,974
Stop saying everything you say. Got it.

1076
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,811
That's it. How about I dogpile you?

1077
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:56,106
How about you leave him alone?
What the craznocks is wrong with you?

1078
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,859
What? How about you make me?

1079
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:04,531
Oh, that's right, you can't.

1080
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:08,827
Because I'm big and you're small.

1081
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:14,749
Yeah, I'm small. We're all small.
But together, we're big.

1082
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:18,294
You think these stupid losers
are going to team up against me?

1083
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:23,007
I can do anything I want to them,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

1084
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:27,178
And the same goes for you, Pukas.

1085
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,681
Dogpile!

1086
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:35,520
I said, dogpile!

1087
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:40,859
-You heard the man.
-Dogpile!

1088
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:47,198
No! Don't hurt me! Mommy!

1089
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:50,368
Hey, you guys want to come over
and play?

1090
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,829
Yeah, cool. Come on, Lucas.

1091
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,748
I'll catch up.
There's something I gotta do first.

1092
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,751
Yeah ! All right!

1093
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,462
Oh, yeah.

1094
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,632
They sure grow up fast.

1095
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,802
-What?
-Look what I got.

1096
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,220
Oh, no. Zoc.

1097
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:13,391
Zoc! Wait! Wait! No, no! Stop!

1098
01:20:13,601 --> 01:20:15,143
Come on.

1099
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,813
Stop it! I'm serious....

1100
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,236
Sweet rocks!

1101
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:01,460
