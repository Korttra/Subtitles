1
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:52,226
Long ago at the dawn of time,

2
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:54,793
the great Nuo lit
the very first fire

3
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:57,622
in the heavenly kitchen

4
00:00:57,753 --> 00:01:02,845
and created all of the foods
that inhabit the world,

5
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:06,936
using the powerful magic
of the fabled Five Flavor Stone.

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,504
She gave all foods
their own unique flavor,

7
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:13,769
sour, sweet, bitter, spicy,
and salty.

8
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:16,337
Yeah!

9
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,383
For a thousand years
all was peace and harmony

10
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:23,039
until the evil Kung Pao Chicken
fell from the sky

11
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,694
and stole the Five Flavor Stone.

12
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,880
Only the strength and courage
of the ancient

13
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,578
Grandmaster Lu Chen
saved the world

14
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,146
from destruction as he bravely
fought against

15
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,583
the hideous monster
in the battle that

16
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:47,585
lasted for days and days.

17
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,639
As every dumpling knows
Master Lu Chen

18
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:01,251
conquered the chicken,
restored the Five Flavor Stone,

19
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:05,125
and turned the chicken
into a lake of soup.

20
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,781
Our hero, our hero,
you saved us!

21
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,481
Mmm, tasty.

22
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,657
It was then that Master Lu Chen
said...

23
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:19,182
My children, there is a hero
inside all of us.

24
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,885
Many generations have passed
and still the Five Flavor Stone

25
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,409
has yet to be found.

26
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:34,066
Today there are some bad dudes
out there who are not happy

27
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,677
with who they are.

28
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,506
They want the Five Flavor Stone
to make them powerful.

29
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:41,204
Legend tells that
in our darkest hour,

30
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:43,989
a hero will rise to save us
once again.

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,426
Master Lu Chen said,

32
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,993
"“There's a hero inside
of all of us."”

33
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:51,823
So that hero could be you
or you, or maybe even me.

34
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,218
Silent sushi smackdown.

35
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:57,873
Hooa!

36
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,571
Sizzling Szechuan shakedown.

37
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,705
And now the unstoppable
chopstick chaos.

38
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,317
Uh, sorry.

39
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:10,015
Bao, you seem to have lost
your staff.

40
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,887
Teacher, will succeed next time.

41
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:15,891
No, there won't be a next time
needed, because uh,

42
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,501
your training is complete.

43
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,068
No more can I teach you.

44
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,896
My training is complete, what?

45
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,027
Huh?

46
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,946
I confer upon you the status
of uh, Super Bao.

47
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,339
Yes, Super Bao.

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,819
Here, take this.

49
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,909
Call to adventure?

50
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,127
You know it.

51
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,042
Fight you some evil.

52
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,261
But what if this is not...

53
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,741
Not what Bao?

54
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,569
What I was meant to do.

55
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,485
I have so much to learn
and for sure,

56
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,530
I have yet to receive
total enlightenment.

57
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,270
Ow!

58
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,580
You're enlightened.

59
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,973
There is a hero inside
all of us, Bao.

60
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:56,845
You are ready to find yours.

61
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,107
But my things?

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,196
Way ahead of you.

63
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,502
Here you go.

64
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,504
But I have no weapon.

65
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:07,029
Hmm, hold that thought
we have something just for you.

66
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,335
What is it?

67
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:10,380
Only the finest weapon
in the land.

68
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,252
The Staff of Destiny.

69
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:24,002
Um, yes, yes, long, long ago,
Grandmaster Lu Chen saved

70
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,615
the world with this very weapon
and became a legend.

71
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:32,663
Now Super Bao, it is your turn.

72
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:36,754
So go now, fight evil wherever
you will find it.

73
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,148
Master?

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,715
Super Bao.

75
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,325
Please no.

76
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,981
Please, kid, don't make this
harder than it already is.

77
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:02,345
Grandmaster Lu Chen,
I want you to know.

78
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:05,305
I will bind a hero
inside of my dough.

79
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:12,703
DISCIPLE 1 He's finally gone.

80
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,402
After all these years,
young Bao is out in the world.

81
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:16,664
Wow.

82
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:20,232
Five years, eeesh,
woefully unprepared,

83
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,712
he's out to save the world.

84
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:24,541
Good heavens, do you know
what this means?

85
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,238
More food for us.

86
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,027
You must have faith
in his abilities

87
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,246
to be giving him the Staff
of Destiny.

88
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:36,118
That's just a souvenir
from the gift shop.

89
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:36,901
Get real.

90
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,381
Uh...

91
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,776
The staff is from the gift
shop, right?

92
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,606
Um, may be.

93
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:50,741
Oh no, we lost it,
the Staff of Destiny.

94
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,613
I'm ready, I'm ready.

95
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,484
I'm ready to fight evil.

96
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:57,139
Who's the big hero that's gonna
save the world?

97
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:59,576
Are you one of the greatest
warriors in the land?

98
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:00,882
Check.

99
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,710
Do you have a burning desire
for adventure?

100
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,885
Yup.

101
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,104
Are you on a mission
to vanquish evil,

102
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,758
wherever you shall find it?

103
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,847
Whoa.

104
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,327
Then bring it on.

105
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,459
Perfect.

106
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,589
A seaport.

107
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,519
You are here today,
because you think

108
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,608
you are the best of the best,

109
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,437
but to be chosen,
you must be faster.

110
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,397
You must be stronger
to join our ranks.

111
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,529
You must have courage
and bravery

112
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,532
of the highest order,
make no mistake that this...

113
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:45,317
This will be the most dangerous
and important mission

114
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,493
of our town.

115
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,067
Now, with that said,
who will face this here,

116
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,810
samurai warrior to earn
themselves the final spot

117
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:00,941
on our ship.

118
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:06,208
Who is ready to be a hero?

119
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,378
- I am, I am.
- I am, I am.

120
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,210
I am.

121
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,341
Pick me!

122
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,173
A round puffy bun against
the hardened samurai warrior.

123
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,655
Now this challenge is gonna
be a good one.

124
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:19,786
Hmm.

125
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,223
Begin.

126
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:22,659
Fight!

127
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,530
Hi, I'm Super Bao.

128
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,660
Huh.

129
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,232
No fair, I wasn't ready.

130
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,279
Two out of three.

131
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,151
Sorry, kid.

132
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,281
You're out.

133
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:38,769
But I'm invincible
with this weapon.

134
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:39,633
Hmm.

135
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,417
That's right, Staff of Destiny.

136
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:42,829
Shuh, shuh, shuh,
shuh, shuh, shuh.

137
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:43,941
Wait, one more try.

138
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:46,161
I need this gig, please.

139
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,597
Kid, take a hint already.

140
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,730
Security,
we gotta a live one here.

141
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,861
One more try.

142
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:53,908
What's this?

143
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:59,043
No fair, my opponent cheated
and I want one more try.

144
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:00,958
Hmm.

145
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,528
My staff.

146
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,749
Whoa, can I have that please?

147
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,359
Young, foolish bun.

148
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
Not everyone in this life
can be a hero.

149
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,190
Go home now, a hero you are not.

150
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,499
Here's your papers,
you're hired.

151
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,953
CHARACTER 1 Our crews are
complete and we are ready to sail.

152
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:46,264
Hey kid, you still want to go
to sea with a bunch of warriors?

153
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,919
That's right,
I've been watching you.

154
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,792
And in my pro-opinion,
you've got some real talent.

155
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:54,882
Master, may I join your ship
today?

156
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,014
Master's my dad, call me Twi.

157
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:58,581
Yes, take me to sea.

158
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,278
Okay, follow me.

159
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:04,152
Hmm, aren't we in a battleship?

160
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:05,762
No, no, no, no, no.

161
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,677
Our ship is a cooking scout.

162
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:10,419
Oh, I was hoping to be a hero.

163
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,204
Oh, you will be, you will be.

164
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:16,512
You'll be making sure that
our warriors are well fed

165
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:17,992
and prepared to face
our enemies.

166
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,907
Don't you find that all right,
don't you?

167
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:22,300
This is not the mission for me.

168
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,650
But you'll be at sea.

169
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,260
Isn't that what you want?

170
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,699
Well, then suit yourself.

171
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:34,225
We're off on a big adventure.

172
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,358
See you later, or not.

173
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:39,666
This might be the only chance
you ever get to go to sea.

174
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,581
Have big adventure.

175
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,757
Probably the biggest
adventure ever.

176
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,106
And you won't be there.

177
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:45,933
Hmm.

178
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,063
Oh, well.

179
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,153
Wait up, Twi, take me with you.

180
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,634
Smart kid, you won't be
disappointed.

181
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,418
A thing to get out of the way,

182
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,377
there'll be no pay
on this voyage.

183
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,074
That's the bad news.

184
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:00,991
But you would have the most
revered title of all, intern.

185
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:01,818
Intern?

186
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,167
Yup.

187
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,517
Unpaid of course,
but give it a few months.

188
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,608
You never know.

189
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:09,565
No problem.

190
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,698
As long as I have
a place to sleep.

191
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:13,874
Can't have you sleep
with the fishes, can we?

192
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:15,049
Twi, where you been?

193
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,138
We're about to set sail,
my friend.

194
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,748
Our tour is complete.

195
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,402
I have found the intern.

196
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,142
Great.

197
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,578
Unpaid of course.

198
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:23,884
Oh, he knows.

199
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,799
Intern, this is Captain Kui.

200
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:26,974
Nice to meet you.

201
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,106
Hey, hi yourself, young intern.

202
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,370
That's Roli and Dodo.

203
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,024
They're in charge of the sea,

204
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,592
with their special ingredients
added to the food,

205
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,463
everything
will be twice as tasty.

206
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,727
And of course, twice as pricey.

207
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,990
Sweet and sour, my favorite.

208
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,730
I love it.

209
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,775
I'm sure you do.

210
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:49,039
But if you smell any longer,
I'll have to charge you.

211
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,389
Come on, I'll give you
the grand tour.

212
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,695
Let's make this part quick.

213
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,656
This one's for barbecue
and don't miss

214
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,440
our all-you-can-eat ribs night.

215
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,181
Can we leave before I evaporate?

216
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,573
Sure thing.

217
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,054
Garlic room, my favorite.

218
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:04,794
Ugh.

219
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:06,622
Man, I'm from heaven.

220
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:07,971
And this room is for boiling.

221
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,756
No way!

222
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,237
Hooray!

223
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,674
A steam room.

224
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,546
The perfect spot,
and it's just for me, right?

225
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,117
Here you'll be intern
and seize the house.

226
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,815
Cool breeze, wind in your hair,
and did I promise you

227
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,164
an ocean view?

228
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:29,123
Ready to eat.

229
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,428
Let's rock.

230
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,823
You're now a part of history,
intern.

231
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:37,131
The largest armada to ever sail
the Seven Seas.

232
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,071
Cool.

233
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,334
Good morning, my birdy buddies.

234
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,740
And then there was the staff.

235
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:24,613
She still there?

236
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,744
Woah!

237
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,050
Ahh, shush!

238
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,181
Hmm.

239
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:46,635
Look, the bun hero.

240
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,508
No, no, no,
it will never happen.

241
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,471
Huh.

242
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,826
Look, warrior food hero.

243
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,611
Go to work!

244
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,794
These are the lotus blossoms.

245
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:20,800
Ooh, that's beautiful.

246
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,150
I've never seen anything
like this.

247
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,675
It's meant to bring us good luck

248
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,633
when we are out
on the high seas.

249
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:30,940
This is strange.

250
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:32,420
Do you know
where we're going now?

251
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,550
Why ask me?

252
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:34,638
I just work here.

253
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,904
Whoa, that's weird.

254
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:42,082
Why are the ships going
in different directions?

255
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:47,261
Oh, pasta prima princess.

256
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,350
Soldiers, meh.

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,833
Oh, salmon ninja.

258
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,357
Wait, what is he doing?

259
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,750
It's almost like he's leaving
a trail.

260
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,580
Huh, where did he go?

261
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,237
Oh, the food.

262
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:13,243
Everyone look,
I see a bad storm arising.

263
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,507
Holy classic rock,
we must change direction.

264
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,553
That's a negative.

265
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,337
We must complete our mission
in time.

266
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,689
Full speed ahead.

267
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,343
Full speed ahead.

268
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:29,433
Attention, everyone,
assume your positions,

269
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,523
clear for action,
we are sailing into the storm.

270
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,836
Hey Twi, I lost sight
of the ships.

271
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,142
Don't worry about that now.

272
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,013
While we get this one
under control.

273
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:48,713
Help!

274
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,152
Woah!

275
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,457
Woah, woah, woah.

276
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,807
Oh, ah!

277
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,419
CHARACTER 4 Intern,
intern, you all right?

278
00:14:58,549 --> 00:14:59,549
I'm fine.

279
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,337
The fleet is scattered,
collisions are imminent.

280
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,816
Beacon lights.

281
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,384
Beacon lights.

282
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:16,916
Hey, this storm ain't so bad,
right,

283
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,787
it's not like we've seen any...

284
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:26,621
Okay, crew, battle stations.

285
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,492
- Battle stations.
- Guard the map.

286
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:30,190
Uh, uh, uh.

287
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,672
A ship, a ship is on fire.

288
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,468
Pirates.

289
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,470
I hate those guys.

290
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,187
Oh crap.

291
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:18,498
Here they come.

292
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,635
Got ya.

293
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,534
Uh, pirates.

294
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,802
What a week I'm having.

295
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,939
Princess.

296
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,640
Woah!

297
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,817
Do the only chance we have
is to get the ship under control

298
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:17,166
and take off.

299
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:17,862
What?

300
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:18,993
What?

301
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,824
We're going to collide,
someone do something.

302
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,261
Somebody?

303
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:26,741
I don't want to hear this thing.

304
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:27,350
Uh.

305
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,831
Uh...

306
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:41,799
Whoa.

307
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,192
- Oh.
- Whoa.

308
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,672
It's gonna sink any second.

309
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:45,977
What do we do?

310
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,371
Look!

311
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,372
Hello, up there.

312
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,245
Don't worry we'll rescue you.

313
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,116
Intern, fetch the ladder.

314
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:01,602
Hey, hang on up there,
we'll get you no matter...

315
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,474
No, no, no, no.

316
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,997
Ah.

317
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,348
Sail away, sail away!

318
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:09,566
Incoming!

319
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,094
Surrender.

320
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,272
Don't worry, Dodo,
I'll save you.

321
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:30,587
Uh, uh.

322
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,207
I'm Lord Octopus,
king of pirates.

323
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:27,470
All hail the king
of the pirates!

324
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,690
You better back up,
the big fleet is coming

325
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
very, very soon.

326
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:31,909
Oh, the big, bad fleet.

327
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,783
Your fleet is a cover up,
just ask these two.

328
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:37,219
That's right...

329
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,631
Me... they've captured
my new friends.

330
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,961
Collection of warriors.

331
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,616
Is you sail to a secret island
during a celestial vortex.

332
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:43,746
Oh, no.

333
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,274
A place that is rumored
to house the true location

334
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,754
of the very ancient
and very powerful

335
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,713
Five Flavor Stone.

336
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:53,670
What is this?

337
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,803
To find it, you will need a map.

338
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,934
A map like the one,

339
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,110
your pretty princess
just gave me.

340
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,767
Resistance is futile.

341
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,639
Disobey me
and you'll all be fish food.

342
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,424
Staff of Destiny,
give me your strength.

343
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:10,121
Of course, if you cooperate...

344
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,081
Warrior food hero.

345
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,474
Eyah!

346
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,779
Nobody threatens my boat.

347
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,390
Ah.

348
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,130
We're under attack.

349
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:19,957
Huh.

350
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:22,308
He's just a bun.

351
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,483
Hmmph.

352
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,267
Salmon Samurai!

353
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,931
Hiya!

354
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,674
Your skills are no match
for mine.

355
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,284
Stand down and I will spare you.

356
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:43,981
You spare me the small talk.

357
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:45,722
So be it.

358
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,253
You have been beaten, stay down.

359
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,909
Never!

360
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,085
Ha!

361
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,216
Hiya!

362
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:17,537
Oh, no, we've lost the...

363
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:18,755
No!

364
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,453
Poor guy.

365
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,411
Yamazon, you will have to work
twice as hard

366
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,153
with the loss of your brother.

367
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,024
As you wish, my lord.

368
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:51,875
Hmm, might be useful.

369
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,430
Oh, woah!

370
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,040
Oh.

371
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,133
Shackles?

372
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,353
Hey, Cal, what gives?

373
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,921
Hey, give that back.

374
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,662
Come on, it's mine.

375
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,230
Oh.

376
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,538
Can't talk and uh!

377
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,365
Ow!

378
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:48,454
Hey you!

379
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:49,368
Ow!

380
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,239
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

381
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,154
Oof, egghead,

382
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,025
I'm talking to you,
you are my prisoner.

383
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:00,291
And yet you are the one
in chains.

384
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,554
Miner point.

385
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,860
Article 32, section 14
of the samurai code...

386
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,601
Enough with the rules, dude.

387
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,560
Let me go right now,
so we can fight.

388
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,174
A prisoner must make no attempt
to escape.

389
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:14,828
Ugh, give it up!

390
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,183
The captive speaks
only when spoken to

391
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,030
and only when directly addressed
by his captor.

392
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,882
Captive?

393
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,208
Prisoner must follow all orders
of his captor without exception

394
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:28,929
and without delay.

395
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,321
Ugh!

396
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,235
Prisoner will be treated
with care and respect.

397
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:32,759
Ugh.

398
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,978
Article 22, section 15
of the samurai code states,

399
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,749
that if there is a violation
of article...

400
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:43,204
Ugh.

401
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,119
Pawn slime.

402
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:48,165
Now, give me back that
the staff or die.

403
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,341
Ugh, give it!

404
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,431
Now, it is the paddle
of destiny.

405
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:55,259
Do not bash the Staff
of Destiny.

406
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,522
It's no paddle.

407
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,652
Show respect.

408
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,395
Not respect.

409
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:01,352
It's a paddle now.

410
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,483
We will find ship.

411
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,920
You paddle too, prisoner.

412
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,794
Okay, convict, move it.

413
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:24,114
Hey, sushi breath,
what's the deal?

414
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,986
I have a plan.

415
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:28,162
Is getting lost
your brilliant plan?

416
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,599
Samurai can track a target
by smell alone.

417
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,730
Ridiculous.

418
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,820
Do you even have a nose?

419
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,560
Whirlpool.

420
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,778
Whirl what?

421
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,040
Woah!

422
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,389
Hang on!

423
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,565
What?

424
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,696
You hang on.

425
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,916
Whoa, you'll never get away
from me!

426
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,769
Come, prisoner,
the ship is in this direction.

427
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:10,900
Follow me.

428
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,207
Okay, super nostrils.

429
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,643
Whoa!

430
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:17,820
Remember you're my captive,
I got my eye on you.

431
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,174
Hey, prisoner, slow down.

432
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,615
You're shackled to me,
remember who is in charge.

433
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:30,745
Hmm.

434
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,967
Hmm.

435
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:35,882
Oh, ugh.

436
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:36,796
Okay.

437
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:37,927
Break time.

438
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,146
Take watch.

439
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,076
Suffering seaweed,
what's that smell?

440
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:57,817
Lord Octopus is near.

441
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,646
Oh.

442
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:03,083
Oh.

443
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:04,650
Hmm.

444
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,348
What do we need to do
is get to that ship.

445
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:10,481
Ha, easy-peasy, bro.

446
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:15,225
Mmm, and got it.

447
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,879
Hey!

448
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,099
Prisoner, what are you doing?

449
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:20,229
- Escaping.
- Guess again.

450
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,101
Huh!

451
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,231
The key!

452
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,235
I dropped it.

453
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:27,977
Stay put, dough boy.

454
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,413
Not so fast.

455
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:32,894
Hiya!

456
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,028
Got it.

457
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:36,158
Don't got it!

458
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,379
My freedom!

459
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,772
My honor!

460
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,954
You are such a drag.

461
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,570
Up and down.

462
00:26:58,181 --> 00:26:59,226
It's okay, I got it.

463
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:01,620
No, mine.

464
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,750
Got you.

465
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,374
Are we gonna be here forever?

466
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:18,375
I'm hungry.

467
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,986
What's up?

468
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:23,467
What is the Five Flavor Stone
the Octopus spoke of?

469
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:26,383
It's new as magical stone,
created to flavor the foods

470
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,254
of the world.

471
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,604
What? You're kidding.

472
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,867
The sacred Five Flavor Stone
really exists?

473
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,521
Yes.

474
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,306
From a legend long ago,
every thousand years a vortex

475
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:39,614
opens to the island that
contains the Five Flavor Stone.

476
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,007
We were to protect it.

477
00:27:41,137 --> 00:27:42,182
But now...

478
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:43,792
- Oh.
- Ugh.

479
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:45,228
Who are you?

480
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,621
Hmm.

481
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,144
Uh, I am...

482
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:51,104
He is Forsea, keeper of the map.

483
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:51,844
The map?

484
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:54,107
Uh, what was in it?

485
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,196
Well, uh...

486
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:59,852
It is an ancient sea chart,
Forsea found it in his research.

487
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:01,984
It marks the true location
of the island.

488
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,551
Mhmm.

489
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,380
We must retrieve it
and then prevent Lord Octopus

490
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,816
from getting to the island.

491
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:08,730
Mhmm.

492
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,099
Well, that's not gonna be easy.

493
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,123
What do we do?

494
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:14,170
Uh, I say we eat the map keeper.

495
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:15,432
Hmm.

496
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:16,042
Oh.

497
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,172
Mm-mm.

498
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,832
Lord Octopus,
I have protected you.

499
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:25,355
I have brought you to the map.

500
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,444
My mission with you is complete.

501
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,625
I will now collect my reward
and go in search of my brother.

502
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,062
Hmm.

503
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,238
Your brother is certainly gone.

504
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:40,457
And our work together
has just begun.

505
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:45,506
What if I could offer you
untold wealth, hmm, and power?

506
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:47,726
What would you say to that?

507
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:50,816
Not so bad
for the loss of a brother.

508
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,078
I don't know.

509
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,123
My dreams can be
quite expensive.

510
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:57,561
- How expensive?
- Very expensive.

511
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:59,346
No price is too great.

512
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:01,478
Once I have the stone,
I can fulfill all.

513
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:02,609
Hmm.

514
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,357
Hey, birdy, birdy, birdy,
here, birdy, birdy, birdy.

515
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:11,487
That's it.

516
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:17,581
Moron, stand down,

517
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:20,323
we have no idea what dangers
lurk on these islands.

518
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,456
Yes, Lord Octopus!

519
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,504
Hmm, unusual for birds to fly
that way.

520
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,160
You have lost us the key,
round bun.

521
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,162
You're blaming me for this?

522
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:35,251
Shackled together
we move slowly.

523
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,819
Plus, I can no longer smell
Lord Octopus.

524
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,994
We must leave.

525
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,912
Oh, look, a monkey.
Aw, he's adorable.

526
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,751
Hey monkey, throw us the key.

527
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,666
Uh, nice monkey.

528
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,797
Don't eat the key.

529
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:01,843
No!

530
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:02,974
Bad monkey.

531
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,543
Very, very bad.

532
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,371
Stop eating the key!

533
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,460
Wooh!

534
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,114
Huh?

535
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:14,638
Uh-oh, easy monkey, look out.

536
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,292
Look!

537
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:17,554
Oh!

538
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,687
Oh.

539
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,906
Oh.

540
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:28,217
Okay uh, listen guys,
sorry about your buddy.

541
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,368
I know what it looks like,

542
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,046
but that was totally
an accident.

543
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:47,280
We have not time
for monkey business.

544
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,195
Hey, stop monkeying around!

545
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:51,632
I'm cut.

546
00:30:58,421 --> 00:30:59,640
Okay.

547
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,120
Little help.

548
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,121
Thanks a lot.

549
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:03,687
Oh, sweet ginger!

550
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,649
Oh, Salmon!

551
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,478
You will be my little
dumpling doom, ha!

552
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,135
You guys are banana nuts.

553
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,616
Hey, Staff of Destiny.

554
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,662
Chopstick of fury maneuver.

555
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:26,493
They're back.

556
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,842
Sushi roll 'em over.

557
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,278
I like it.

558
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,107
Let's banana peel out of here.

559
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:35,719
Dough!

560
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,112
Roll!

561
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,679
And whip!

562
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,377
Hey.

563
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,379
Throw in the face maneuver.

564
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,815
Get ahead of 'em.

565
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,252
Runaway fast maneuver.

566
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,644
You ain't so bad.

567
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:48,602
Hey, bun, stop.

568
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:49,342
Take that.

569
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,517
- Don't push.
- What?

570
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,181
Huh?

571
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,358
Barrel of monkey hook maneuver!

572
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,281
Oh, monkey block.

573
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,597
At least,
we're goin' down swinging!

574
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:31,993
No time for jokes!

575
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:34,300
Can you think of a better time?

576
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,518
Whoa!

577
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,261
Uh?

578
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:43,700
Ha-ha, we're cool, you drool!

579
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:44,831
Whoa!

580
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,880
My dumplings.

581
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,249
Hm, my sacred orbs,
give them to me.

582
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,622
Huh?

583
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:53,536
Hmm?

584
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,885
Hmm, it is a warrior's armor.

585
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,193
Are you losing your mind?

586
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,717
You got fish eggs on your head.

587
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:02,197
Huh?

588
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:04,417
And I've got a monkey
on my face!

589
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:06,245
No, not the butt!

590
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,160
Please, not the butt!

591
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,900
Mm, where is that ship?

592
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:10,901
Sushi breath.

593
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,381
Are you seeing this?

594
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:15,645
Whoa, easy with the claws there,
monkey!

595
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,605
Whoa,
he's really diggin' in now!

596
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,955
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Salmon!

597
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,086
Silence, sweet roll.

598
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,740
We've no time
for this foolishness.

599
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,570
Yeah, yeah, I'm with ya.

600
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:33,707
Get off me, monkey!

601
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,362
Go back to your home!

602
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:43,412
Anywhere,
just not on my head, monkey!

603
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:50,941
Come on.

604
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,682
You're slowin' me down.

605
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,816
You go any slower
and I'll have to carry you.

606
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,867
Do you require rest?

607
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:05,913
What? No.

608
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:15,053
Just a little dehydrated.

609
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:16,184
Need to moisturize.

610
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,752
Mm, we will rest out.

611
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,323
Oh, I thought I build a sauna.

612
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:32,374
Oh, creative!

613
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:39,207
And stretch this over here.

614
00:34:39,338 --> 00:34:40,948
A little agua.

615
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:46,997
And flame.

616
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:52,568
And voilà, steam.

617
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,443
Ooh, ah, perfect.

618
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,314
Except for the monkey
on my head.

619
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,055
Tail out of my ear, please.

620
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,578
♪ Ba da da boom

621
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,145
♪ Ba da da di

622
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:08,236
Don't you know?
Steam, it is my dream.

623
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:09,977
Nobody's gonna slow me down.

624
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,587
Wow.

625
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,937
Now that's what I call livin'.

626
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:16,244
I know what this needs.

627
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:18,159
Yeah, garlic!

628
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,814
Thank you, Nu Wa.

629
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:24,078
Yo, sleeping beauty,
need a little room here.

630
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:25,209
This will wake him up.

631
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,036
Come on!

632
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,167
Oh!

633
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:29,736
Yeah.

634
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,826
Mmm.

635
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:34,262
Mmm.

636
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,612
Mm, that's the stuff.

637
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:38,919
Huh?

638
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,616
Hungry?

639
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,009
Go ahead, little fella.

640
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:44,533
Knock yourself out.

641
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:50,104
Kinda spicy, huh?

642
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,975
Sorry, my little simian.

643
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:54,021
Sort of my acquired taste.

644
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:59,331
Mm.

645
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:00,549
Oh, disgusting.

646
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,160
What's wrong?

647
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,683
Garlic has rented odor.

648
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,337
Not fit for samurai.

649
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:06,816
Shows what you know.

650
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,644
You ever tried it?

651
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:09,776
Best in the world.

652
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,651
No,
this is the best in the world.

653
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,740
Huh?

654
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:21,048
Ew, gro...

655
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,179
Wasabi.

656
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,836
You had me at the sword.

657
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,795
Whoa, I didn't mean that!

658
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,844
Huh?

659
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,675
Samurai warrior must keep
his weapons free

660
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,155
from imperfections.

661
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,331
You can clean that weapon
all you want,

662
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:46,769
but it will always be dirty
from the dirty work you do.

663
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,945
If Octopus wins, it's over.

664
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,296
You'll have no honor.

665
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:54,212
Article 97,
samurai is like sword

666
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,952
and knows neither right
or wrong.

667
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:58,999
Ridiculous.

668
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:02,481
True heroes only do good
and punish bad.

669
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,744
Samurai do not think
in absolutes.

670
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,137
You fight with the bad guys,
you're a bad guy.

671
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:07,964
Hmm.

672
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,749
Ugh!

673
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,621
You fight for the good guys,
well then, you're a good guy.

674
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,366
Huh?

675
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,285
What's that?

676
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,201
You brought a snack for me
this time?

677
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,247
Oh, thanks.

678
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,379
Huh?

679
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,559
Yuck, sour!
So sour!

680
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,821
And you knew it.

681
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,997
Punked by a monkey, that's it!

682
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,261
I'm gonna turn you into a bat.

683
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,748
Don't be afraid, Dodo.

684
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,750
I'm sure brother Bao
is on his way

685
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,361
to save us right now.

686
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,188
The intern?

687
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,582
He's just a rookie kid
off the street.

688
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,932
He dreams of bein' a hero.

689
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,586
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

690
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:09,461
Lord Squid Breath
will have the stone by tomorrow.

691
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:13,116
Not if his ship never makes it
to the island.

692
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,075
Something you'd like to share?

693
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,207
Because without a miracle,
we're in the soup.

694
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,557
Yes, Choy.

695
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:20,994
Uh, do you have a plan?

696
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,823
Hmm, I always have a plan.

697
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:26,086
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

698
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,001
First, we have to distract...

699
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:37,489
What? What?

700
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,491
What? Oh!

701
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:41,406
Oh no.

702
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:42,842
Little bun, wake up.

703
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:44,278
We have a grave situation.

704
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,671
Wake up, it's a fire.

705
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,541
Fire?

706
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:50,850
Where did this come from?

707
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:55,594
Huh, fire?

708
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,378
Why didn't you tell me
there was a fire?

709
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:58,074
Look out!

710
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,033
Salmon, run!

711
00:39:00,163 --> 00:39:01,513
Where to now?

712
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:03,210
I do not know,
but I must escape.

713
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,907
Heat and sushi do not mix.

714
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:07,301
Holy barbeque!

715
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:08,433
Come on, this way.

716
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:10,086
Getting weaker.

717
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:14,830
Get up!
I thought you were tough.

718
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,049
Come on!

719
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,488
Oh, now, what's he doing?

720
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,360
Oh, my vision.

721
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,361
Something is wrong.

722
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:24,318
Hey, little buddy.

723
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,972
Little buddy, don't go up there.

724
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,408
I'll make you a path.

725
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,804
Must hurry or I'll be cooked.

726
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,937
- Huh?
- Uh?

727
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,810
W... w... what is happening?

728
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,203
Whoa!

729
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:41,814
I'm turning into buns of death!

730
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,076
Oh no.

731
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,346
Sweet Jesus!

732
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:53,608
I can't breathe!

733
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,525
Monkey, look out, it's hot!

734
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,401
Now what?

735
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,013
Huh?

736
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,494
Whoa, popcorn!

737
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:12,975
Huh?

738
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:13,976
Huh?

739
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,500
Holy snack!

740
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:20,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

741
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:27,860
Whoa, w... what is this?

742
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,557
Onion rings of doom.

743
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,907
Mmm, tasty!

744
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,996
No, not tasty, deadly!

745
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,128
I am allergic!

746
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:41,134
Oh, my eyes, they're stinging!

747
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,966
Thank goodness,
this is mozzarella!

748
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:49,838
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

749
00:40:57,977 --> 00:41:01,197
My arms, I cannot tell
if they are all here.

750
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,853
Big tough warrior.

751
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,944
I'm glad I'm not allergic.

752
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,425
A little onion juice
and you're all tears.

753
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:17,779
I cannot smell, I cannot see.

754
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,041
Mmm.

755
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,434
Where is my wasabi?

756
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:22,915
Can't see, huh?

757
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,917
I'll help you.

758
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,965
Oopsie.

759
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:39,105
So, you can't smell
and you can't see?

760
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:41,673
Mmhmm, hmm.

761
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,979
Hmm?

762
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,459
Whoa, you really can't!

763
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,678
Are you gonna get better?

764
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:49,028
Negative. I am defeated.

765
00:41:49,158 --> 00:41:51,160
Strike the final blow.

766
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,033
If I kill you now,
I'll just have to drag you.

767
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,383
You could escape. Let me die.

768
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,081
What good would that be?

769
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:00,866
You're my prisoner, remember?

770
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:03,129
Let's go.
What direction is the ship?

771
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,259
Mm-mm.

772
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,350
We've got to get moving.

773
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:12,573
Here, take this stick
and don't run into anything.

774
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:16,577
Why do you do this?

775
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,013
Why?

776
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:20,320
I can trade you
for my crew when we find them.

777
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,539
Hmm.

778
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,584
And... hey, you can help me
build a boat.

779
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:24,890
Show me how.

780
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,820
I can only teach you
if you swear to the code.

781
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,417
That code again!
You're steaming my buns!

782
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,767
But okay, what do I have to do?

783
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:33,898
Very well.

784
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,640
State your name and your rank.

785
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,946
Super Bao, warrior.

786
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:39,121
Okay, are we done?

787
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:40,035
Let us begin.

788
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,515
The book has many lessons.

789
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:42,886
We will start at the beginning.

790
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:44,691
Rule number one.

791
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,346
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, where are you going?

792
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,478
How will we do this
if you do not listen?

793
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:51,133
Article number one
of the samurai code states,

794
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,482
"A new initiate..."

795
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,812
Who is the man?

796
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:19,292
You are a bun.

797
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,165
And now you are lunch.

798
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:52,934
Salmon?

799
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,240
Hmm.

800
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:57,591
There that's better.

801
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,860
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

802
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,395
Hi.

803
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:44,116
Everything is just getting
further and further out there.

804
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:47,641
Every quest begins
with a single step...

805
00:44:48,903 --> 00:44:50,296
Hmm.

806
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,910
Master, I could really use
a sign.

807
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:02,961
Wait for it. Wait for it, mmhmm.

808
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:05,311
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

809
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,627
Ah, lookin' good.

810
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,281
Okay, and very good.

811
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,936
Lookin' very, very...

812
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:24,459
Prisoner?

813
00:45:24,504 --> 00:45:25,723
Hey there, handsome.

814
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,246
I was just admiring your teeth.

815
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:29,204
They're almost perfect.

816
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:31,685
Huh, they are perfect.

817
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,295
Eh, not quite,

818
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:36,429
but teeth are so very difficult
to keep clean.

819
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,736
Trust me, I've tried everything!

820
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,042
I use special
bucktooth whitening strips.

821
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:43,349
Ah, give them to me.

822
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:46,395
Oh no, I couldn't possibly,
it's my last one.

823
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:49,703
But I'll probably never use it.

824
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,662
Perhaps, I'd be willing to part
with it.

825
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:58,712
That whitening strip
would make my teeth perfect.

826
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:01,541
- Mmhmm.
- Hmm, okay.

827
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:04,500
Say "cheese"!

828
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:12,334
Okay, here's the plan.

829
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:15,903
Kui, you're a pancake,
you can stand the heat.

830
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,123
Get in there
and get those exploding coals.

831
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,082
Whoa, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

832
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:25,608
For the rest of us,
we create distraction

833
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:27,567
while Roli goes down
to the galley.

834
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:30,396
We only get one shot at this,
so Roli, make it spicy

835
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:31,852
- and blow up the shit.
- I'm on it,

836
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,660
Let's go, kick some wheat grass.

837
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:38,970
Lord Octopus!

838
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,754
Lord Octopus,
the prisoners are revolting!

839
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,061
What? I know they're revolting!

840
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:44,889
Oh, I mean they're escaping!

841
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:46,019
Huh?

842
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:51,199
You can't escape this.

843
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,897
Huh, coal?

844
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,027
Stop, stop!

845
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:58,032
Now that's what I call
a fish fry!

846
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:01,557
Yeah, imbeciles, stay down!

847
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:02,558
And here's the fish.

848
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:03,733
You're out of here.

849
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:05,779
And you, too!

850
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,781
Stop them! Get those pastries!

851
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,914
Yamazaki, do your thing.

852
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:24,711
I hate Chicken Boy.

853
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,147
There you are.

854
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,678
You idiot!

855
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:39,813
Time for a little
calamari shish kebab.

856
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:43,948
My lord!

857
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:45,079
Huh?

858
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:50,998
Cut the noodling,
bring her down!

859
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:53,609
And down.

860
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,003
I've got this.

861
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,364
End of the line, pretty pasta.

862
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:11,976
Bring it, shrimp cocktail.

863
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,473
This really burns my bun.

864
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:36,304
Fish sticks!

865
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,872
Moron, what am I paying you for?

866
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:45,356
Sayonara!

867
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:52,059
Freeze, squid breath.

868
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,105
- Ugh, you do stink.
- I agree.

869
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:55,235
I heard that.

870
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:58,457
Lord Octopus,
we've captured them all!

871
00:48:58,587 --> 00:48:59,675
Game's over, princess.

872
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:04,332
Huh, that's what you think.

873
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,204
Two prisoners are missing.

874
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,727
What?

875
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,424
Where are they?

876
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:11,905
Tell me now or you will boil.

877
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:15,561
They're cookin' up something
special just for you.

878
00:49:15,691 --> 00:49:16,691
Dodo, chili powder.

879
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:18,259
Uh, okay.

880
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,262
Roli, you got to make it spicy
and blow up the ship.

881
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:23,134
Use the hottest stuff you got.

882
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:24,918
Oh, please, Dodo, hurry.

883
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:27,529
Hmm, where is that smell
coming from?

884
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,836
Uh?

885
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,795
Oh, got it!
Boom-boom time!

886
00:49:35,276 --> 00:49:37,409
- This oughta do it.
- Hmm.

887
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:40,238
Come on, Dodo.

888
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:41,891
Kitchen's closed.
The end.

889
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,022
- Yippie!
- Hey!

890
00:49:44,503 --> 00:49:45,591
Bon appetite.

891
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:49,595
Gotcha now, little jelly roll.

892
00:49:50,813 --> 00:49:51,945
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

893
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,999
- Huh?
- Hmm.

894
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:03,609
What?

895
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,785
Look, guys, you need to join us.

896
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:08,353
Now, hurry up, idiots,
and get my ship together.

897
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:12,009
On it, got it.

898
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,795
- Whoa, Salmon!
- Hmm.

899
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:18,754
If you could see what I see,
it's the ship.

900
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,452
It looks like a beached whale.

901
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:22,193
This is our chance. Come on!

902
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:23,977
I remind you, I cannot see.

903
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:25,108
That's great.

904
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:26,512
You won't see
all the bombs coming.

905
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:29,896
For once, you are right.

906
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,075
Ah, what is this?

907
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:39,514
That smell, it's familiar.

908
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:43,301
Must be a chicken soup lake!

909
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,955
Oh, come on, let's go.

910
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:47,522
Oh, you can't see.

911
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,655
No problem. I'll lead the way!

912
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:51,526
- Please, no.
- Yeah!

913
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:52,527
My grandmuffin told me

914
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,094
chicken soup
could cure anything.

915
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:55,487
It could cure you.

916
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,924
Its restorative powers
work wonders for the body

917
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,317
and soul.

918
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:03,582
Hmm.

919
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:06,063
Hmm.

920
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:10,110
Huh, wow! It really works!

921
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:13,113
Hey, have some soup.
It's worth a try.

922
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:14,854
It can't hurt,
maybe it could heal you.

923
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,769
- What?
- Hmm.

924
00:51:16,899 --> 00:51:19,902
Warrior must never accept help
from an enemy or a foreign soup.

925
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,861
Ditch the stupid samurai rules!

926
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,341
You're just hopeless.

927
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:25,125
- Hmm.
- Hmm

928
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:28,085
- You wanna see again?
- Hmm.

929
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:31,218
- You know you want to.
- Hmm. Hmm.

930
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:32,828
I must live with this condition.

931
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,569
You don't sound like a warrior.

932
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,441
Come on, man up. Give it a try.

933
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:43,361
Huh?

934
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:46,842
Hmm, not bad, eh?

935
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:48,235
Hmm, not bad at all.

936
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:50,932
Wait a minute!

937
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,413
Take it easy on that stuff.

938
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:56,025
Huh, well, how do you feel?

939
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:57,288
Mm.

940
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:58,506
Can you smell the wind?

941
00:51:58,637 --> 00:51:59,637
Uh...

942
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:00,856
Can you see the sunshine?

943
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,688
Let me take this off.

944
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,474
Whoa, what a rush.

945
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:11,084
I can see.

946
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:14,653
- How do you feel?
- Awesome.

947
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:16,698
Hey, what's gotten into you?

948
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:23,705
Beautiful, man. Just great!

949
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,799
I smell life in all

950
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,411
its spectacular precious forms.

951
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,629
Groovy!

952
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,283
Uh, you got too much soup.

953
00:52:37,545 --> 00:52:39,330
Easy, bro,
it's gone to your head.

954
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,114
Check out the sun, man.

955
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:43,769
It's like a giant flower

956
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:48,077
with petals of love!

957
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,905
Hey, I found some cool junk.

958
00:52:50,036 --> 00:52:52,908
Let's build a boat, bro.

959
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,606
Okay, now you're scaring me.

960
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,828
- Huh?
- I got way cool skills.

961
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:01,787
Surf's up, little bro roll.

962
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:09,447
I think that I shall never see,
a poem lovely as a tree,

963
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:11,753
or a lake of awesome
chicken soup,

964
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,712
created just for me.

965
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,369
I heard chicken soup affects
everyone differently,

966
00:53:17,455 --> 00:53:20,588
but this is just nuts!

967
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:22,068
Chill, man.

968
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,505
I've created a monster. Huh?

969
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:28,117
No, that's too much soup!

970
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:30,424
Hey man, get your own,
this boat is mine.

971
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:31,643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

972
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:35,429
A little soup uh,
cures what ails you.

973
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,085
Too much,
and your mind fails you.

974
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,610
Yo, a little soup cures
what ails you.

975
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:44,743
Too much,
and your mind fails you.

976
00:53:44,873 --> 00:53:47,528
Genius! Genius!

977
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,965
You're a wicked poet.

978
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:51,097
Huh?

979
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,186
I used to totally be
into poetry.

980
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,536
Had dreams when I was younger.

981
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,669
At night, I'd read this book.

982
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:00,846
Huh, Chicken Soup
for The Warrior Soul?

983
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:03,588
Young bun, I still know
not your name.

984
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:05,764
Ugh, I'm Super Bao.

985
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:07,766
Super Bao.

986
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:09,071
Super bun.

987
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:11,944
Ha, like buns of steel.

988
00:54:13,511 --> 00:54:15,295
Right. And you would be?

989
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:18,429
Uh, hmm,
I am 15th generation descendant

990
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,213
of the attendant to Knight,

991
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,409
who was the personal guard
to the distinguished chancellor.

992
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,826
Nice to meet you.

993
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:27,176
Not sure I heard your name
in there.

994
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:28,307
What is it?

995
00:54:28,395 --> 00:54:29,831
You can just call me "Salmon".

996
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:31,224
Cool?

997
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:33,531
My brother and I are the last
of our family

998
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:35,750
and it's our mission
to restore the honor

999
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:37,056
of samurai everywhere.

1000
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:38,840
- You dig?
- Huh?

1001
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:42,322
Fighting for an evil octopus
doesn't sound honorable.

1002
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,281
Oh, it ain't like that, cupcake.

1003
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:47,371
Me and the bro have to
take a shady gig now and then.

1004
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:50,069
One more cash grab
with the stinky cephalopod

1005
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:52,463
and we're off to the store.

1006
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:54,291
The glory of the samurai.

1007
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:55,572
You're fighting
with the bad guys.

1008
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,729
Not cool, not glorious.

1009
00:54:57,859 --> 00:55:00,775
Uh, hey, what's the story
with this hunk of junk anyway?

1010
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:03,300
Hey, put it down!
That's the Staff of Destiny.

1011
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,779
Leave it alone!

1012
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,303
More like a toothpick.

1013
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:09,697
No, actually, you can
save the world with that staff.

1014
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:12,091
Oh, the Popsicle stick
of destiny.

1015
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:14,354
- Whoa.
- Huh?

1016
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:17,444
What's that, dude?

1017
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:18,663
Huh?

1018
00:55:25,017 --> 00:55:26,627
Oh, the ground is tofu.

1019
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:28,977
Huh?

1020
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:31,153
Whoa! Buzzkill.

1021
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:33,373
Whoa!

1022
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:44,775
He can't see us.

1023
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:46,908
Whatever you do, don't move.

1024
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:55,263
Uh-oh.

1025
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,399
Whoa, my sacred orb.

1026
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,140
Not cool, dude.

1027
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,750
Wait, what are you doing?

1028
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,057
Nobody messes with my head, man.

1029
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:06,232
Cowabunga!

1030
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:13,631
Salmon, look out!

1031
00:56:22,204 --> 00:56:23,815
Oh, we can escape
through those woods.

1032
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,077
He's got my orb!

1033
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:26,315
You can get a fish egg anywhere.

1034
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:28,994
Uh...

1035
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:33,346
Uh, whoa there, easy, froggy.

1036
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:34,869
You don't wanna eat me.

1037
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,307
I'm really not tasty

1038
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:41,398
Oh! Ugh!

1039
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:42,790
I've been kissed by a frog!

1040
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:45,097
Gross! Gross!

1041
00:56:46,664 --> 00:56:48,100
Just stop it!

1042
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,283
So?

1043
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:01,200
Get your guns on the run.

1044
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,422
Hiya!

1045
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:08,337
Okay, reptilio,
here's the dealio.

1046
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:13,342
What's the matter, froggy?

1047
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:14,735
Fish got your tongue?

1048
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:30,534
Whoa! Hmm, so this is what
hangover feels like.

1049
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:33,972
Note to self, chicken soup,
never again.

1050
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,851
I'm... I'm free.

1051
00:57:43,982 --> 00:57:45,897
I'm dizzy.

1052
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:48,203
Samurai must always assess
his situation

1053
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:49,944
and know what's on the menu.

1054
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:52,425
Sometimes, it's him.

1055
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:56,081
If I could just reach my sword.

1056
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:58,213
Now where's my...

1057
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:01,042
Staff of destiny, winning.

1058
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:05,830
Sushi samurai, cooked for sure.

1059
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,266
You made that look easy.

1060
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:10,922
Wait, what's that?
Conscious attack?

1061
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:13,272
True heroes always do
what's right.

1062
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:15,927
Dumb conscience.

1063
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:18,973
Hmm, so this is my end.

1064
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:21,280
A tofu sandwich
in a frog's belly.

1065
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:28,853
Am... am I dead?

1066
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:30,507
Where are my ancestors?

1067
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:33,074
Easy, tadpole, that's my sushi!

1068
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,946
Whoa! Whoa!

1069
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,824
Like links in a chain, Salmon.

1070
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:45,609
We are connected.

1071
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:48,046
Ha-ha, good to see you,
kelp face.

1072
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,919
Thank you, little bun.

1073
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,965
That's what friends are for.

1074
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:00,580
Huh, got you!

1075
00:59:00,711 --> 00:59:02,234
Surprise for zombie slingshot.

1076
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:09,457
Hey, Salmon!

1077
00:59:09,502 --> 00:59:10,938
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1078
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,552
Bao, your staff!

1079
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:17,945
Oh, no!

1080
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,954
We're not finish yet.

1081
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,219
Fly, little bun!

1082
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:40,315
My orb!

1083
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:43,492
My Staff of Destiny!

1084
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,106
Mmhmm.

1085
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:56,027
Yeah, you better run.

1086
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:59,204
Just hop along now,
little froggy.

1087
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:02,294
And don't you come back
no more, no more.

1088
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,994
Woo-hoo! Up high!

1089
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,256
Hmm.

1090
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:13,218
Why didn't you escape?

1091
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:14,785
Because we're friends.

1092
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:16,525
Samurai have no friends.

1093
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:17,962
Well, you do now.

1094
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:20,007
But we are opponents.

1095
01:00:20,138 --> 01:00:22,270
So you still think
we're enemies, huh?

1096
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,231
Hmm, come on.

1097
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:28,625
We're the only two left
who can save the world.

1098
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:30,801
Friends or not,
we got a job to do.

1099
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:32,237
Let's get cookin'.

1100
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:34,848
Friend.

1101
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:36,763
What would a friend do right now

1102
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:39,287
if he knew his partner
was facing certain doom

1103
01:00:39,418 --> 01:00:41,159
at the hands of an enemy.

1104
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:43,117
What would a friend do?

1105
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:44,510
He would do the right thing.

1106
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:48,819
I'm sorry, friend.

1107
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:57,479
Idiots, morons, imbeciles!

1108
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,092
How long can it possibly take
to repair one ship?

1109
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:03,355
My lord, it's only been
10 minutes.

1110
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:05,749
10 more minutes

1111
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,925
and I started pulling fins.

1112
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:09,578
Huh, understood, my lord.

1113
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,363
Back to work
or I'll drop off your fins

1114
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:13,017
and make soup out of all of you.

1115
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:14,975
I'm so hungry I could eat
an entire crew.

1116
01:01:16,324 --> 01:01:17,543
My lord, I returned.

1117
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,849
Salmon?

1118
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:21,155
Brother, where is your prisoner?

1119
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:23,854
Escaped into the forest.

1120
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,420
No harm, no foul.

1121
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:28,206
He's just an itty-bitty
steamed bun after all.

1122
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:29,381
- Hmm
- Right?

1123
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:30,948
- Sushi Samurai is back.
- Hmm?

1124
01:01:31,078 --> 01:01:32,427
Uh, intern?

1125
01:01:32,558 --> 01:01:33,951
No, I don't see him.

1126
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:35,561
He's probably just
hangin' around.

1127
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,266
Salmon!

1128
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:54,232
I'll get you for this!

1129
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:57,496
Well, you're just in time,
fish head.

1130
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:02,022
Just in time to witness
the fulfillment of my destiny

1131
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:05,417
as I obtain the flavor stone.

1132
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:08,812
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

1133
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:14,121
Only if your destiny
is to be a smelly one.

1134
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,601
That's right.

1135
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,125
"Smelly octopus",
that's what they call me,

1136
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:20,693
because I'm cursed
by the hideous odiferousness

1137
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:23,130
of the smell beyond my control.

1138
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:27,656
While you pastries will always
be fresh and oh-so appealing,

1139
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:30,137
I am destined
to slither the world awash

1140
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:33,184
in this awful,
noxious, salty odor.

1141
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:41,105
Yo, that's brutal, bro.

1142
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:43,063
We're salty, too!

1143
01:02:43,194 --> 01:02:45,413
But once I control
the Five Flavors Stone,

1144
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:48,286
I will make myself the ultimate
and sweetness.

1145
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,114
Stinky octopus no more.

1146
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:54,205
You'll all beg for a whiff
of my awesomeness!

1147
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:57,556
You will use the stone
to change your flavor?

1148
01:02:57,686 --> 01:03:00,254
Was that somehow not clear
from the monologue?

1149
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:03,344
Then pastries ain't exactly
the deepest dish in the kitchen.

1150
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:06,086
Am I right? Or am I right?

1151
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:10,743
Everyone else will be salty

1152
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:14,312
as I gain control of all
the flavors of the world!

1153
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:17,097
Yeah!

1154
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:22,276
I would think
you will feel honored

1155
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:27,629
as you will the first
of my salted food test subjects.

1156
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,068
Forever onward, you will be
salt, salt, salt, salt,

1157
01:03:31,198 --> 01:03:32,198
and salt.

1158
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:35,376
In your dreams, ink spot!

1159
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:36,682
Huh?

1160
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,032
Hold on, my friends,
I'm here to rescue!

1161
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,949
What happened?

1162
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,038
This can't be.
How did he escape?

1163
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:51,262
Yo, there, I am Super Bao,
direct descendant

1164
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:53,960
of Grandmaster Lu Chen
and you are all in big trouble!

1165
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:55,353
Eeh, ooh!

1166
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:57,790
We call ourselves
"a tough guy" up in here.

1167
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,792
Salmon Ninja, turn that red
into stuffing.

1168
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:10,020
Bao, watch out!

1169
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,195
Hiya!

1170
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,071
Stop, Salmon.

1171
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:19,203
Leave now!

1172
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:24,556
Got you!

1173
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:27,037
One way or another,
I'm going through you.

1174
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,082
You know fighting your heart.

1175
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:33,913
Mm-mm, mm-mm, this won't do.

1176
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:37,264
It's clear,
which brother is best.

1177
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:40,354
You're no match for me.

1178
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:42,008
Escape
while there is still a time.

1179
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,621
This is getting painful
to watch.

1180
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:47,927
Mm-hmm-hmm.

1181
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:50,582
Ah, let's wrap this up now.

1182
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:10,341
Little hero, do you happen to
have any last words?

1183
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:13,474
People in loincloth
shouldn't skip underwear!

1184
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,740
Plot twist!

1185
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:19,871
Someone end this.

1186
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:20,959
Yes, sir!

1187
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,225
Brother, spare him,
he saved my life.

1188
01:05:25,356 --> 01:05:26,618
I have no bother.

1189
01:05:28,794 --> 01:05:30,883
You have been a nuisance
for far too long.

1190
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,929
Please, brother.

1191
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:35,279
Hiya!

1192
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:38,543
Oh, the Staff of Destiny!

1193
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:46,507
The ground is reaching
volcanic ash

1194
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:49,858
and soon it will suck you dry.

1195
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:52,557
You tried to be a hero
and know you will pay

1196
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,168
the ultimate price
for your stupidity.

1197
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:57,083
And what do we have here?

1198
01:05:57,214 --> 01:06:00,869
Get your stinking tentacles
off of the Staff of Destiny.

1199
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,220
Ooh, Staff of Destiny.

1200
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,656
How very theatrical!

1201
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:06,527
But now they are... let's see...

1202
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:11,184
Mm, the chop sticks of destiny
or nothing at all.

1203
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:16,494
Well, you get the idea.

1204
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:19,635
My lord,
the ship has been repaired.

1205
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:21,586
Finally. No more delays!

1206
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,981
Let's blow this taco stand
and take that sushi prisoner.

1207
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:26,417
Yes, my Lord.

1208
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:28,134
Batten down the hatches,
hoist up the jib!

1209
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:29,942
Uh, what's the jib again?

1210
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:32,945
Still a little unclear
on hatch battening, too.

1211
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:35,817
Brother,
are we doing the right thing?

1212
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,779
Samurai warrior knows neither
right nor wrong

1213
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,563
and a brother I have no more.

1214
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:45,479
Say "goodbye" to your friend.

1215
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:51,572
Hurry forward!

1216
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:54,053
We must reach the Temple
of the Five Flavors now!

1217
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:56,229
Well, that rescue
didn't go with...

1218
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:26,303
You are such a failure to me.

1219
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:27,956
Please, save us.

1220
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:29,480
Friend. Friend.

1221
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:35,138
You owe me 50 bucks
for the steam room!

1222
01:07:49,543 --> 01:07:51,893
Oh, no! The staff!

1223
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:55,940
Huh?

1224
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,032
Super Bao,
you look so perplexed.

1225
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:01,642
What is your problem?

1226
01:08:01,773 --> 01:08:03,688
Uh...

1227
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:06,560
Grandmaster Lu Chen,
I let you down,

1228
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,997
the Staff of Destiny
is gone forever.

1229
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:13,698
First of all, Bao,
I am not Grandmaster Lu Chen.

1230
01:08:13,828 --> 01:08:15,874
I don't...
I don't quite understand.

1231
01:08:16,004 --> 01:08:18,224
If you're not Master Lu Chen,
who are you?

1232
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:21,053
See, the thing is
I'm just a rock that kinda

1233
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,577
looks like Grandmaster Lu Chen.

1234
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:24,926
I'm a statue, kid.

1235
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:26,102
Oh.

1236
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:27,755
What's troublin' you, son?

1237
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:29,235
Talk to the rock.

1238
01:08:29,366 --> 01:08:30,628
All is lost now.

1239
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,499
My friends have been captured.

1240
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,675
I let down my master
and the Staff of Destiny

1241
01:08:34,806 --> 01:08:35,806
is broken.

1242
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,809
I'm no hero.

1243
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:43,467
Super Bao, can you not see
that I am a hero?

1244
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:45,860
You said yourself,
you're just a rock.

1245
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:46,861
Yes.

1246
01:08:46,992 --> 01:08:48,689
And I've been out here by myself

1247
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,518
for thousands of years
in the wind and rain.

1248
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:53,999
Master Lu Chen couldn't have
done that.

1249
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,828
Standing still
never helped anyone.

1250
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,091
Without master Lu Chen,
I'm doomed.

1251
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:01,006
It was a weathering metaphor.

1252
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,138
Never mind.

1253
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:04,401
Now I have a question for you,
Bao.

1254
01:09:04,531 --> 01:09:06,142
Why didn't you fall?

1255
01:09:06,272 --> 01:09:10,320
Uh, is it because the chain
saved me?

1256
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,670
Nah, it wasn't the chain.

1257
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,976
It was you who grabbed it.

1258
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:18,850
You're a great hero, Bao,
and you can save yourself,

1259
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,809
and don't worry
about the Staff of Destiny.

1260
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,856
We have them in the GitHub

1261
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:27,424
as a simple slab of stone.

1262
01:09:27,554 --> 01:09:29,861
I might not know much,
but I know this,

1263
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:32,385
there's a hero inside all of us.

1264
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:35,519
It is not what's in your head,
but what's in your heart.

1265
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:37,521
Greatness for the warrior begins

1266
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:39,653
by believing in yourself.

1267
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:42,700
Ah!

1268
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,877
There's a hero inside me, too.

1269
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:49,097
Reach, Bao, reach for the hero.

1270
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:52,231
I will. I will!

1271
01:09:56,453 --> 01:09:58,542
Now, reach, Bao.

1272
01:09:58,672 --> 01:10:01,109
Reach with all your might.

1273
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,634
Yes, old wise rock,
I will reach.

1274
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:04,764
Reach, Bao.

1275
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:06,245
I will, I am,

1276
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:08,943
but it's kinda harder
with you talking all the time.

1277
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:10,162
Sorry.

1278
01:10:21,869 --> 01:10:23,131
Oh, I did it.

1279
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:43,935
This map is not accurate.

1280
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:49,636
What is this Wall of Stone?

1281
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:50,942
Where is it?

1282
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,598
Where's the sacred Temple
of the Five Flavors?

1283
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:56,426
I don't know, I don't, I don't.

1284
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:58,689
No, I know, I know, I know,
I don't.

1285
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:01,039
Where, oh, where, oh,
where is my temple?

1286
01:11:01,169 --> 01:11:02,867
The map say it should
be right here.

1287
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,652
- What's wrong with this map?
- Uh, it's a place map.

1288
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:07,132
What?

1289
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,744
Oh, what am I going to do
with this guy, Yamazaki?

1290
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,443
I know. I'll cut him
into tiny little carbo chunks

1291
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:15,619
for the sharks
to munch on him tomorrow.

1292
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:19,753
Unless, I see my palace
in the morning.

1293
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:21,233
Oh, boy.

1294
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:38,032
Hey, little guy.

1295
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:42,472
Uh-oh.

1296
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:47,346
Thank you for saving me,
monkeys.

1297
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:51,263
And hey, I know we started off
on the wrong path, but... huh?

1298
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:52,743
The Staff of Destiny!

1299
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:54,875
You fixed it!

1300
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:08,672
Oh, what a beautiful morning,
oh, what a beautiful day.

1301
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:10,804
I've got a terrible feeling,

1302
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:13,154
a bread roll, I'm going to slay.

1303
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:16,026
You're gonna die.

1304
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:18,159
Where is it?

1305
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:19,290
Now!

1306
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,688
Where is the palace?

1307
01:12:25,863 --> 01:12:27,255
I don't know, try GPS.

1308
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:32,043
I've got a world to run,
flavors to change,

1309
01:12:32,173 --> 01:12:34,872
lives to destroy,
and you don't know?

1310
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:35,829
No, no, no, no.

1311
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,396
I don't, I don't.

1312
01:12:39,137 --> 01:12:40,817
Look, master,
there's writing on the cliff.

1313
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:41,878
What does it say?

1314
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:44,011
Huh?

1315
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:44,925
Huh?

1316
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:46,362
Hmm.

1317
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,321
Let me see.

1318
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:54,326
Step aside.
Give me that map.

1319
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:58,069
Whoa!

1320
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:01,812
By bread, by meat,
by Nu Wa, let's eat!

1321
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,783
Oh!

1322
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:19,482
Whoa!

1323
01:13:24,225 --> 01:13:26,184
Oh, don't just stand there!

1324
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:28,578
Merman, your stations!

1325
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,014
- Alright, chief.
- Get to it.

1326
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,891
There we go.

1327
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:43,201
This is amazing.

1328
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:46,117
Sail on. Sail on!

1329
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:52,079
Drive the ship forward.

1330
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:56,301
There it is, the fabled Temple
of the Five Flavors!

1331
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,998
- Oh!
- Ah!

1332
01:13:58,129 --> 01:13:59,435
It's magnificent.

1333
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:04,178
There is the entrance.

1334
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,269
Ah!

1335
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,882
Quickly, we must descend
the 5,000 steps to have it.

1336
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:13,753
5,000, huh?

1337
01:14:13,884 --> 01:14:14,928
Hmm.

1338
01:14:27,288 --> 01:14:28,899
Finally.

1339
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:32,163
The Temple
of the Five Flavors Stone.

1340
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,038
Oh!

1341
01:14:38,169 --> 01:14:39,475
Oh!

1342
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:41,564
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

1343
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:42,478
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:45,916
Isn't it incredible, Yamazaki?

1345
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,874
Yes, my lord. Quite.

1346
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:50,355
Oh!

1347
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,444
Oh!

1348
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:54,272
Yes, yes.

1349
01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:56,143
Oh!

1350
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:58,755
Mmm.

1351
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:04,238
Oh.

1352
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,209
The Five Flavors Stone.

1353
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:24,476
Eeh, mm, yeah.

1354
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:28,219
Yes, reveal your secrets to me.

1355
01:15:40,448 --> 01:15:41,841
Nature is in chaos.

1356
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:43,626
He must be near the stone
by now.

1357
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:46,629
Game over, man.

1358
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:50,458
Goldfish!

1359
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:51,589
King.

1360
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:58,162
Huh? Huh?

1361
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:01,339
- Look, up in the sky.
- It's a bird!

1362
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:02,862
Huh?

1363
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:08,738
Looks like, could be,
it's a sticky bun!

1364
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:11,001
- No, it's Bao!
- Intern!

1365
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:13,394
It's just a bun
with a few monkeys.

1366
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:14,831
Make that many monkeys.

1367
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:16,572
Archery details!

1368
01:16:16,702 --> 01:16:17,702
On it!

1369
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,664
Oh, my bad.

1370
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:26,320
There's a hero inside all of us.

1371
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:28,192
Attack!

1372
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:33,501
Barrel of monkeys hook maneuver!

1373
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:39,290
Hang on, everyone, I'm coming!

1374
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:43,207
- Hiya!
- Ow!

1375
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,557
Huh? Oh, oh.

1376
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:49,300
- Bao!
- Intern!

1377
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,563
Let's make that bun
a big sandwich.

1378
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:04,315
Thank you, warrior.

1379
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:06,534
All in a day's work, princess.

1380
01:17:08,536 --> 01:17:09,536
Here we go.

1381
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:16,153
Salmon!

1382
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:22,159
Hmm.

1383
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:26,816
Hiya!

1384
01:17:29,122 --> 01:17:29,949
Huh?

1385
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,690
Uh, didn't get you there, did I?

1386
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:32,996
I'm fine.

1387
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:35,433
You gotta admit though,
that was cool.

1388
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:39,480
Super Bao, we have to get
a move on.

1389
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:40,873
Octopus has the stone.

1390
01:17:42,222 --> 01:17:44,877
It isn't over
until the plate is clean.

1391
01:17:54,104 --> 01:17:56,280
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

1392
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,456
this one here is good to go.

1393
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:01,372
Oh, yeah.

1394
01:18:01,502 --> 01:18:04,418
Soon I will control the flavors
and consume all that is good

1395
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:05,549
in the world.

1396
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:09,206
Not if we came out there.

1397
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:13,819
Welcome, my flavorful friends.

1398
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:16,517
You're just in time,
just in time to become

1399
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:19,520
my very first test subjects.

1400
01:18:19,651 --> 01:18:22,959
Round, and round,
and round they go,

1401
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:25,657
and where they stop,
only I know.

1402
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:31,054
My mother told me to pick
the very best one and...

1403
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:33,012
Drum roll, please.

1404
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:35,232
Sour!

1405
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,410
What's happening?

1406
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:53,424
And coming up next on
the flavoricious hit parade...

1407
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:55,948
Come on, we have to stop him!

1408
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:00,300
Keep going!

1409
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:02,694
Spicy!

1410
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:04,391
You'll never get away with this!

1411
01:19:04,522 --> 01:19:08,526
I already have,
because all that's left...

1412
01:19:08,656 --> 01:19:10,963
Salty.

1413
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:26,936
Take cover!

1414
01:19:45,737 --> 01:19:47,521
What's our next move, princess?

1415
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,088
Whoa!

1416
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:52,004
Salted fish?

1417
01:19:57,923 --> 01:19:59,533
What's wrong with them?

1418
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:03,929
Salt zombies!

1419
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:06,627
Now there is something
you don't see every day.

1420
01:20:06,758 --> 01:20:08,281
And now here they come!

1421
01:20:08,412 --> 01:20:09,848
Quick, behind that rock!

1422
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:20,250
Uh, over here if you need me.

1423
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,731
Princess is in trouble.

1424
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:24,862
Princess!

1425
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,695
Oh no!

1426
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:31,609
Kui!

1427
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,872
Can't move.

1428
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,575
- I'm out!
- I know where to hide.

1429
01:20:41,706 --> 01:20:43,839
We can't save Kui
unless we stop this.

1430
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:46,276
Intern, what are you doing?

1431
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,452
Keep away from the salt!

1432
01:20:48,582 --> 01:20:49,757
Don't get saltified!

1433
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:54,284
Bao, be careful!

1434
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:56,112
Bao!

1435
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:59,202
Oh, no, the intern!

1436
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:01,421
He's not going to make it.

1437
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:11,344
Kui, I can do it.

1438
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:13,999
Come on. A little more.

1439
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,403
Let's do this thing.

1440
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:29,406
Right behind you.

1441
01:21:37,762 --> 01:21:39,242
Salt.

1442
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:40,852
The salt is everywhere!

1443
01:21:43,594 --> 01:21:45,770
Oh, it's super power!

1444
01:21:52,298 --> 01:21:54,257
Who invited the leftovers?

1445
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,348
Surrender now,
you tiny appetizers

1446
01:21:58,478 --> 01:22:02,265
and I just might keep you
on the menu as my slaves.

1447
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:04,745
- Never!
- Wrong answer.

1448
01:22:04,876 --> 01:22:06,791
Cover your eyes,
cover your eyes!

1449
01:22:08,097 --> 01:22:09,185
Is it over?

1450
01:22:10,534 --> 01:22:13,232
No, keep them closed!

1451
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:15,365
Daddy like it.

1452
01:22:19,717 --> 01:22:22,850
Get off, brine brain.

1453
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:24,635
Oh no, Roli.

1454
01:22:24,765 --> 01:22:26,593
Hand over
the Five Flavors Stone!

1455
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:29,205
Certainly. But first...

1456
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,258
I should've killed you
the moment I had that chance.

1457
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:41,565
It is not too late to end this,
my brother.

1458
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:43,132
It is for me.

1459
01:22:44,263 --> 01:22:46,178
Hiya!

1460
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:49,051
If it isn't the tiny morsel
of hero?

1461
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,444
And I'm in the mood
for a little bite.

1462
01:22:51,575 --> 01:22:52,837
Ow!

1463
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,970
Blugh!

1464
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,320
You taste worse than you smell!

1465
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:58,450
I heard that!

1466
01:23:00,758 --> 01:23:02,325
You've grown tough, brother.

1467
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:03,455
Enough of your games.

1468
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:05,502
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hiya!

1469
01:23:07,634 --> 01:23:08,634
Miss me?

1470
01:23:11,551 --> 01:23:13,466
Whoa! What do we do now?

1471
01:23:13,597 --> 01:23:15,164
Samurai circled maneuver.

1472
01:23:15,294 --> 01:23:16,295
Good thinking.

1473
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:17,470
Let's move.

1474
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:25,304
My staff!

1475
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:28,916
Now you will taste justice.

1476
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:30,092
Taste this!

1477
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:32,311
The sour stone!

1478
01:23:32,442 --> 01:23:35,358
Oh, my eyes!

1479
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:47,935
It doesn't have to end this way.

1480
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:52,157
Join me and together
we will enjoy

1481
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:54,072
the spoils of the world.

1482
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:57,683
Not on my watch.

1483
01:23:57,771 --> 01:23:59,730
Back off, scale face!

1484
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,820
Huh? Wait, no! It's me, Choy!

1485
01:24:04,778 --> 01:24:06,389
My arm is turning salty.

1486
01:24:06,519 --> 01:24:07,519
Save me!

1487
01:24:10,915 --> 01:24:13,004
Help me, please, anyone!

1488
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:14,745
Oh, heavy.

1489
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,399
Oh, heavy!

1490
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:23,406
I will join you no more.

1491
01:24:23,536 --> 01:24:25,930
Have it your way.

1492
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:31,066
Hmm? Garlic?

1493
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:33,807
Hmm, Super Bao.

1494
01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:37,159
Pathetic pastry,

1495
01:24:37,289 --> 01:24:39,248
even as you face certain
destruction,

1496
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:40,640
you continue to fight.

1497
01:24:49,997 --> 01:24:52,609
Nunchakus of Destiny!

1498
01:24:58,136 --> 01:25:03,315
I do not like your smell,
but garlic, give him hell.

1499
01:25:17,764 --> 01:25:18,852
Hiya!

1500
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:51,407
Is that garlic?

1501
01:25:51,537 --> 01:25:53,278
Garlic is the new wasabi.

1502
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:05,334
Is this all you got?

1503
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:08,293
You ain't seen nothing yet!

1504
01:26:16,867 --> 01:26:19,261
Oh, no!

1505
01:26:23,526 --> 01:26:26,311
Had enough or you're thirsty
for more?

1506
01:26:26,442 --> 01:26:31,142
My appetite for destruction
knows no bounds!

1507
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:35,755
Nothing can stop
my ultimate power.

1508
01:26:35,886 --> 01:26:37,322
Huh?

1509
01:26:38,410 --> 01:26:40,978
Run. Run, run!

1510
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:48,420
Now my small foes, you will die!

1511
01:26:57,647 --> 01:26:59,953
Run, but you'll never escape.

1512
01:27:05,176 --> 01:27:08,397
Zombies? What a year I'm having.

1513
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:10,660
Forsea, please, listen.

1514
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:13,532
Hang in there. Hang in there.

1515
01:27:13,663 --> 01:27:16,013
Tell Super Bao

1516
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:20,844
he still owes me 80 bucks
for the steam room!

1517
01:27:20,974 --> 01:27:22,498
Twi, Twi, Twi!

1518
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,068
Well, I gotta say
this hasn't been fun

1519
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:30,288
you know, just because of you.

1520
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:33,639
And now,
before the credits roll...

1521
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:34,988
Salmon, his mouth!

1522
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:36,120
Hmm?

1523
01:27:38,644 --> 01:27:39,776
The stone must be in there.

1524
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:43,909
Up we go.

1525
01:27:46,957 --> 01:27:47,957
Go!

1526
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:49,612
Samurai toss maneuver.

1527
01:27:51,788 --> 01:27:53,006
Oh, you amuse me.

1528
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:56,314
Hiya!

1529
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:57,272
Grab the chain!

1530
01:27:57,402 --> 01:27:58,490
Whoa! Whoa! Got it!

1531
01:27:58,621 --> 01:27:59,621
Now pull me up! Pull!

1532
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,675
If his partner was facing
certain doom,

1533
01:28:09,806 --> 01:28:12,243
a true friend
would do the right thing.

1534
01:28:17,553 --> 01:28:19,294
Oh!

1535
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:25,300
Goodbye, my friend.

1536
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,260
Salmon.

1537
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:47,583
You've been found!

1538
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,108
My flavor!

1539
01:28:57,201 --> 01:28:58,201
Now what? Now what?

1540
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:00,030
What do I do? What do I do?

1541
01:29:05,557 --> 01:29:06,993
Oh, oh, oh!

1542
01:29:07,124 --> 01:29:10,693
Oh, what is happening?

1543
01:29:10,823 --> 01:29:12,172
No!

1544
01:29:12,303 --> 01:29:16,220
Hey, I can control the flavors!

1545
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,266
Hey, Octostomp.

1546
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:21,399
Huh?

1547
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:23,488
Eat this!

1548
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:27,057
My power!

1549
01:29:33,063 --> 01:29:34,107
Oh, no!

1550
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:35,457
Dodo, come with me.

1551
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,199
Roli?

1552
01:29:42,028 --> 01:29:43,508
Dodo, she's alive!

1553
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:45,510
Yayee! Yayee!

1554
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:47,643
Super Bao must have
the Five Flavors Stone!

1555
01:29:47,773 --> 01:29:49,035
Intern did it?

1556
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,863
Wait, he owes me money!

1557
01:29:50,994 --> 01:29:52,996
Wait for me!

1558
01:29:53,126 --> 01:29:56,086
Oh no!

1559
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:58,828
Help me!

1560
01:30:05,008 --> 01:30:07,358
Salmon! Salmon!

1561
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:10,535
Salmon!

1562
01:30:14,104 --> 01:30:15,322
Lookin' for the stone!

1563
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:16,453
Huh?

1564
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,023
Is the stone in here somewhere?

1565
01:30:20,153 --> 01:30:21,459
No, Salmon.

1566
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:22,590
Salmon?

1567
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,681
There's the stone.

1568
01:30:25,811 --> 01:30:27,987
Huh? Huh?

1569
01:30:28,118 --> 01:30:29,641
I have to rescue it.

1570
01:30:35,299 --> 01:30:36,431
Oh no.

1571
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:38,258
We've got to get out of here.

1572
01:30:38,389 --> 01:30:39,956
We haven't got much time.

1573
01:30:50,793 --> 01:30:54,057
Wait, it's going to fall apart!

1574
01:30:54,187 --> 01:30:56,973
The stone must be meant
to stay here.

1575
01:30:57,103 --> 01:30:58,931
It's all collapsing.

1576
01:30:59,062 --> 01:31:01,456
Get back to the ship!

1577
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:03,675
Super Bao, we have to go!

1578
01:31:03,806 --> 01:31:04,894
Now!

1579
01:31:05,024 --> 01:31:07,679
Not without Salmon!

1580
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:15,078
Wait!

1581
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,906
The island is going to sink.

1582
01:31:17,036 --> 01:31:18,603
Salmon!

1583
01:31:18,734 --> 01:31:20,953
What's happening?

1584
01:31:21,084 --> 01:31:22,868
Everybody, get back to the ship!

1585
01:31:22,999 --> 01:31:25,088
- Whoa. W... what happened?
- Huh?

1586
01:31:25,218 --> 01:31:27,046
Super Bao, now!

1587
01:31:36,316 --> 01:31:37,579
Come on, Boa.

1588
01:31:37,709 --> 01:31:38,709
Huh?

1589
01:31:40,973 --> 01:31:42,671
- We must save the rest!
- Huh?

1590
01:31:42,801 --> 01:31:45,369
Wait, it's too late, Bao!

1591
01:31:46,805 --> 01:31:48,285
There's just no time!

1592
01:31:48,415 --> 01:31:49,678
Come on, Twi!

1593
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:53,290
Uh, okay.

1594
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:56,119
Princess, do we get the stone?

1595
01:31:56,249 --> 01:31:57,512
It's not important.

1596
01:31:57,642 --> 01:31:59,601
Lord Octopus is no more.

1597
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:06,042
- Let's go.
- Let's sail! Ship sail!

1598
01:32:06,172 --> 01:32:07,913
On it!

1599
01:32:08,044 --> 01:32:10,481
Huh? Uh-oh!

1600
01:32:23,146 --> 01:32:24,234
Look out, little one.

1601
01:32:24,364 --> 01:32:26,018
Oh
- Oh.

1602
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:28,020
Oh!

1603
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:49,868
Super Bao, Salmon was a hero.

1604
01:32:49,999 --> 01:32:51,870
I can't believe
he's really gone.

1605
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:54,612
No one is ever gone
who lives within our hearts.

1606
01:32:54,743 --> 01:32:56,440
He would have wanted you
to have it.

1607
01:32:57,963 --> 01:32:59,661
Thank you, princess,

1608
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:02,011
but I think I'll do just fine
with this.

1609
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:07,059
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to get the stone.

1610
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,196
Already, balance is restored

1611
01:33:13,326 --> 01:33:15,328
and the natural order
has resumed.

1612
01:33:15,459 --> 01:33:18,723
No, the stone was meant
to stay here.

1613
01:33:18,854 --> 01:33:21,334
This is its rightful place.

1614
01:33:21,465 --> 01:33:24,424
Here, safe from all who would
use it for evil.

1615
01:33:24,555 --> 01:33:26,775
You have done well, Super Bao,

1616
01:33:26,905 --> 01:33:30,517
and someday you will see
your friend again.

1617
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:31,910
I hope so.

1618
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:34,217
I really hope so.
