1
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:53,539
I found it!

2
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,828
Take him out.

3
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,697
Do you have a wolf in your belly?

4
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,037
Do we have some meat? I'm thirsty!

5
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,124
Then drink water!

6
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,660
Honey?

7
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,125
Are you okay?

8
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,434
Arquebus,

9
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,040
there is no need to wait
for the wick to burn out.

10
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,415
Light it and pull the trigger, and bang!

11
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:21,489
Sieging the palace is
child's play with this.

12
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,414
Gunpowder?

13
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,411
Give me three to four days.

14
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,831
Tomorrow midnight.

15
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,782
That's too soon.

16
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,283
Tomorrow night. I'm out of time too.

17
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,365
Captain!

18
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,615
Just kill me!

19
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,035
Hold out until tonight!

20
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,706
Who is that?

21
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,578
A man or a beast?

22
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,578
He's a man right now,

23
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,332
but he could be a demon by tomorrow.

24
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,448
A demon?

25
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,996
We must depart in two days' time.

26
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,245
Tell them, the deal is
good until tomorrow.

27
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:38,410
He wants to trade 600 guns
with 10 gwans of silver.

28
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,415
That'll be enough to arm my men.

29
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,535
We'll wipe out the Qing soldiers
stationed here and move in.

30
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:46,542
Where's the ship?

31
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,411
It's docked near Jemulpo.

32
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,532
Get baron park.

33
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,417
Yes, sir.

34
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:16,078
Plotting an uprising

35
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,624
from the heart of the palace?

36
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,458
General?

37
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,083
Where...

38
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,907
Did such a thing come from?

39
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:35,114
The Jemulpo traitors are
keeping their mouths shut.

40
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:38,250
They won't say where it's from,
how many there are,

41
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,947
and what their target is.

42
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,323
Damn you!

43
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,822
If this is a sign of an
uprising against the Qing,

44
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:50,580
I do not know how the
Qing emperor will react.

45
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,830
What do you advise?

46
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,947
It's an act of treachery
against you and the court.

47
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:06,406
We must find the perpetrators
and charge them with high treason.

48
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,743
Indeed.

49
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,207
This is a plot against me.

50
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,039
Initiate an interrogation!
I'll oversee it myself!

51
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,121
General, I know where your loyalty lies.

52
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,994
There is no need to resist anymore.

53
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,535
Who is behind this?

54
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,371
My desire to right the course
of this country is behind this.

55
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,118
Do your worst.

56
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,698
Is that so?

57
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,704
General!
Father!

58
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,661
Give this to Prince Ganglim.

59
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,411
I cannot do that, your highness.

60
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,079
His majesty will not stop.

61
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,497
You cannot go,

62
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,042
but if you must,

63
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,414
kill me first!

64
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,494
Your majesty, they are not traitors,
please release them.

65
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,412
Return at once, this isn't your place.

66
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:33,911
Your majesty, they've armed
themselves with guns,

67
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,077
and conspired a revolt.

68
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,831
If that is not treason, then what is?

69
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,699
Their only desire was to remove

70
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,207
the vile Qing army and rebuild Joseon.

71
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,208
Shut your mouth!

72
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:49,244
I've told you many times
but you refused to listen.

73
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:55,665
Instead of taking care of the people,
you've only listened to disloyal nobles.

74
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:56,873
I said, shut your mouth!

75
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,581
If that is a conspiracy...

76
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,073
It is indeed!

77
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,162
Whether we submit to Ming or qing,

78
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,703
it is I, the king who should decide!

79
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:14,581
Whether this country prospers
or flounders, it is also my decision!

80
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,037
But you defied my will,

81
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,448
and imposed yours, so now
that is a conspiracy!

82
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,907
Then the one behind this plot...

83
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,990
Is none other than me.

84
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,780
The man behind the revolt
was not any one of them,

85
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,164
but the crown Prince of Joseon, your son

86
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,287
and the leader of
the so called traitors, Lee young.

87
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,663
I will accept death as my punishment,

88
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:05,490
so I beg you to stop this
unnecessary slaughter,

89
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,574
and release them at once.

90
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:12,559
Your highness!

91
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,948
Your highness!

92
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,664
Your highness!

93
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,160
Your highness!

94
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:18,875
Your highness!

95
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,032
Your highness!

96
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,490
Your highness!

97
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,200
I'll return soon! See you in Beijing!

98
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,622
There are plenty of beauties
in Joseon too, right?

99
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:03,784
I beg you, have some
dignity as a Prince!

100
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,451
You mustn't say such obscenities
within the palace walls.

101
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,618
Damn it.

102
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,450
Such words are used
only by the peasants.

103
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,684
How could you say such indecent words
when we just set foot on this land?

104
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,541
Please think before you speak...

105
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,541
And let me know before you hit me.

106
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:29,410
We'll develop a beautiful
relationship by doing so...

107
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,167
Wait a minute.

108
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,581
Why didn't anyone come to greet me?

109
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,869
It's the Prince, no less.

110
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,577
I'll give them hell.

111
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,282
These idiots...

112
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,204
Look, was there a war?

113
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,447
Perhaps there was an
attack by the japs...

114
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,993
Go look around.

115
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,996
But you're the warrior, why me?

116
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:09,792
This way!

117
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,374
Do you know where you're going?

118
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:20,159
I'm new to Jemulpo.

119
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,747
This is the right way to the capital,
but where's the town office?

120
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,037
There isn't anyone around to ask either,

121
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,998
not a damn soul.

122
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:34,118
No dogs or cats, not even a rat.

123
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,375
If so...

124
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,250
Look!

125
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,583
There!

126
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:50,123
A plague?

127
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,322
But even so, must they burn the corpses?

128
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,662
I've ordered a lockdown of Jemulpo,

129
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:08,080
and distributed detailed profiles
of the conspirators

130
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:14,123
to give rewards to anyone who informs us
and to behead those in hiding.

131
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,289
You've ordered?

132
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,036
I've relayed your orders.

133
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,331
And?

134
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,159
Prince Ganglim will
arrive in Jemulpo today.

135
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,956
That bastard.

136
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,955
I'd have sent him a royal
order to return in time.

137
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,246
He never appeared for
any official functions,

138
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,742
but he came without hesitation at the
first news of his brother's death.

139
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,749
What future does this country hold?

140
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:15,909
I did not become a king

141
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,242
to let my precious son die before me.

142
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,784
I did not become a king for this.

143
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,657
It's okay.

144
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,623
It is not your fault, your majesty.

145
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,119
What I am fearful of is that

146
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,665
the rumors are unsettling as it is,

147
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,826
but that Ganglim's arrival
may make you worry even more.

148
00:16:47,292 --> 00:16:49,078
Unsettling rumors?

149
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:53,239
The crown Princess found
a something nasty at the shrine.

150
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,744
It was a headless bird

151
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,322
and the bird is a holy thing
which shares its name with you.

152
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,871
The world conspires against me!

153
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,329
What did I do to deserve this?

154
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,948
Should I read your fortune?

155
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,912
Destruction

156
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,535
Princess!

157
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,828
Princess!

158
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,078
It's all right, my child.

159
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,664
Your mother is here.

160
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,393
This is bad, your highness.
What?

161
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:59,909
It's already dark, what do we do?

162
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:05,284
Find something to eat, I'm hungry.

163
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,726
Something to eat?

164
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,412
I'm hungry too.

165
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,325
I'm the one doing all the work,
wouldn't I be hungry too?

166
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,121
Hello? Is anyone here?

167
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:27,952
Anyone?

168
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:29,998
Hello?

169
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:35,331
Can someone answer me?

170
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Innkeeper!

171
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,123
Oh man, what the heck?

172
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,625
Innkeeper!

173
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:47,034
I'm on my way to the palace,

174
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,073
if you got any food to share...

175
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,333
Innkeeper.

176
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,101
I heard a sound here.

177
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,268
Could you help?

178
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,292
Goodness.

179
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,240
Look at that.

180
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,333
Innkeeper?

181
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,665
Minister Kim, it's so-Yong.

182
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,701
The Princess has been locked inside,
as you wished.

183
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,618
His majesty ordered to not feed her
until she confesses,

184
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,116
so she won't last three days.

185
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,872
Good work.

186
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,956
Will she be okay?

187
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,782
She is pregnant, after all.

188
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,780
Pregnant with a traitor's seed.

189
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,115
What about Prince Ganglim?

190
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,867
We don't know the exact
reason of his return.

191
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,873
He won't return.

192
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,042
Pardon?

193
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,032
Damn it.

194
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,739
Not a single ant in sight,
let alone beauties.

195
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,664
Uprising at a time like this?

196
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,578
What? What is it?

197
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,287
Ghost! There's a ghost!

198
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,623
Ghost, my ass.

199
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:19,035
Royal guards! They must be it!

200
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,535
They're here.

201
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,495
We've been instructed to
escort you to the palace.

202
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,948
You're quite late.

203
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,916
My apologies, the message
arrived quite late.

204
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,991
Why bring so many to escort me back?

205
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,893
There is an uprising here...

206
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,782
Aren't you responsible for that?

207
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,707
One-eyed, hook hand, and big scars.

208
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,018
You're royal guards?

209
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:49,226
We must leave at once,
there's a ghost...

210
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,697
Where's my horse? You didn't bring one?

211
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,123
Are you planning to leave without me?

212
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,333
Your highness!

213
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,990
Assassins?

214
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,615
Were you ordered to kill and bury me?

215
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,327
Your highness!

216
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,351
Your highness!

217
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,615
Your highness!

218
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,250
Your highness!

219
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,042
Your highness!

220
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,908
What the...

221
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,998
Has she gone mad?

222
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,329
We must hurry, they got
a whiff of the blood.

223
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,250
Let's go.

224
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:05,623
Please!

225
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,703
What are you doing?

226
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,579
Why are you taking him?

227
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,456
Please!

228
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,532
Why do you need him?

229
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,365
Who are you guys?

230
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,407
And what were those?

231
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,699
Be quiet, the demons are
sensitive to sound.

232
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:34,917
Demons?

233
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:43,739
Those things bit
indiscriminately, I could've...

234
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,124
What are you doing? He
must be interrogated!

235
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,205
Please be quiet!

236
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:52,621
How dare you! You're
talking to Prince...

237
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,535
Prince Ganglim!

238
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,453
Yes, how did you know?

239
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,250
Your highness.

240
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,476
Come on, he's a Prince.

241
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,910
How do you know me?

242
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,332
How did you know I'd go through here?

243
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:08,081
Are you also assassins hired to kill me?

244
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:09,993
Or the traitors

245
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,414
who started the uprising?

246
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,990
Lower your sword.

247
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,623
We're neither assassins nor traitors.

248
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,494
We've been waiting for your return.

249
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,742
I was a servant of crown Prince Lee,

250
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,455
Park Eul-ryong.

251
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:30,744
The one who delivered

252
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,083
his message?

253
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,165
The demons rip humans'
flesh and drink the blood.

254
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,241
Their corpses must be burned.

255
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,824
Or they could come back to life.

256
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,244
What a load of crap.

257
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:53,893
So the burned corpse earlier
wasn't from a plague...

258
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,559
The demons are the plague.

259
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,541
Those who are bitten by them
also turn into demons.

260
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,457
And they'll in turn attack others.

261
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,619
People are turning into demons?

262
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,079
The demons were all
residents of this village.

263
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:12,579
These people's parents,
siblings and children.

264
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:17,448
They may turn into demons instantly
or later, but they all turn eventually.

265
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:18,917
Where are the officials?

266
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,785
Because of the demons...

267
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,323
They fled, using the night as cover.

268
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,666
The rest gathered here because
the demons are rampant at night.

269
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,789
Damn it...

270
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:37,976
Your highness, save my mother.
Please save her.

271
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Dol-gae!

272
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,750
Your highness...

273
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,865
Your highness...

274
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,619
They've been bitten by the demons.

275
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:59,532
If the infected part is amputated before
the infection spreads, they can be saved.

276
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:02,434
They haven't turned into demons,
but we're taking precautions.

277
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,870
Mother, please eat this.
Please eat.

278
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,073
Go on, you must eat to live.

279
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,530
Honey, I'm so thirsty...

280
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,993
Dol-gae...

281
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,823
I need meat...

282
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,620
Bring me some meat.

283
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,226
What was the capital's order?

284
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,036
They locked down Jemulpo.

285
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,414
No one can enter or leave.

286
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,476
They must be notified, to
get military support...

287
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,535
It's no use.

288
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,283
No one from the capital
will listen to us.

289
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:37,393
Save us, your highness.

290
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:38,417
Stop!

291
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:39,708
What's with you?

292
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:41,077
I'm not the crown Prince.

293
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:44,492
Your highness, save us.

294
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,393
Please save us.

295
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,453
Calm yourselves!
Your highness...

296
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:52,155
You'll become one when you
return to the palace.

297
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:53,958
What?

298
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:57,617
You're our last hope,
you can save us all.

299
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,494
Isn't that your brother's final wish?

300
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:01,792
Nope.

301
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,573
You got the wrong guy.

302
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,369
I can't be the crown Prince
even if I wanted to.

303
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,823
So I'll never be your king.

304
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,865
Prince...
Enough!

305
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:18,372
You can't dictate who becomes
the crown Prince, you traitors!

306
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,909
Bring this up again and
I'll lock you all up.

307
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,893
Your highness!

308
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:31,476
Your highness! Please save us!

309
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,456
Stand back!

310
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:48,249
Why did we lay our hopes
on someone like him?

311
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,323
Save us, merciful Buddha.

312
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:58,993
It's rotten.

313
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,164
How much ration's left?

314
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:08,781
Two bags of potatoes
and a handful of barley, sir.

315
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,994
Distribute equally.
Yes, sir.

316
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,115
Beef jerky!

317
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,625
Your highness.

318
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:48,323
I should've taken some
food from the qing ship.

319
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,207
There was so much food...

320
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:57,393
Qing fish cakes, qing
crepes, qing noodles,

321
00:30:57,417 --> 00:31:00,768
qing dumplings...
Qing booze...

322
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,248
Qing ladies...

323
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,784
How could you think of
them at a time like this?

324
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,996
You would too if you
have ever been with one.

325
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,996
Must you return to the palace?

326
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:22,851
The demons are one thing,
but I don't think you'll be welcomed.

327
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:24,615
Someone even sent those assassins!

328
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,577
I have to, I must take
the crown Princess to qing.

329
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,823
What for?

330
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:39,955
Please think before you speak!

331
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,499
She's your brother's wife!

332
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,601
Even if you love the ladies so much,
that's a line you mustn't cross!

333
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,412
That's his will, he
wants her safe in qing!

334
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:55,079
You should've said so.

335
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,413
Is he buried?

336
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:20,075
We were ambushed by these monsters...

337
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,490
Monsters?

338
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,243
It was a nightmare,
neither man nor beast...

339
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:30,496
I barely escaped, they got my men...

340
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:31,792
And the Prince?

341
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,250
He's dead.

342
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:35,559
Are you sure?

343
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,369
I saw it with my own eyes.

344
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,619
The monsters tore him to pieces,
his blood splashed everywhere.

345
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:47,575
Could I get the rest of my money, sir?

346
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,787
Was he bitten by those monsters?

347
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,083
Yes,

348
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,697
so I beheaded it right away.

349
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,792
Follow me.

350
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:12,405
The money we agreed on
isn't enough, my lord.

351
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:17,327
May I have some more
to help bury my men?

352
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:19,667
Open it.

353
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,081
Your silver is down there.

354
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,911
But I don't see anything.

355
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,658
My lord! My lord!

356
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:57,410
The demons must've taken over
Jemulpo. They'll be here soon.

357
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,956
Is it still not the time?

358
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,740
Bring me so-Yong.

359
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,375
Pardon?

360
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,250
Minister Kim?

361
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:24,532
It's so-Yong.

362
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,912
I was deeply concerned whether I caused

363
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,956
you worry.

364
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,624
How could I ever doubt you?

365
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,035
My lord?

366
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,036
Is this the dawn of a new world?

367
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,059
What are you doing this
early in the morning?

368
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,518
We need to go scavenge food.

369
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,748
What about the demons?

370
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,790
They can't stand the sun,
so they only move at night.

371
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:16,101
They hide in vacant
homes or in the forest.

372
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,741
Then why not just kill
them all during the day?

373
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:21,082
They could get us first at night.

374
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,664
You're a beauty under the sunlight.

375
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,414
Ever been to qing?

376
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:37,702
No?

377
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,578
Would you like to come?

378
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:47,165
Qing has more than enough
food and clothes for all.

379
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,851
How could you say that
in times like these?

380
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:50,875
Gosh.

381
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,956
I'm mentioning it because it's true.

382
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,948
To be honest,

383
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:56,914
is this a country?

384
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,740
Why live in fear here?

385
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,824
Cold, hungry, so full of demons.

386
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,373
Ignorance is bliss.

387
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,250
What do you think?

388
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,533
I can take you to qing.

389
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:16,280
You'll live a comfortable life.
Just imagine that.

390
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,409
Why bring up qing when
my home is in chaos?

391
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,911
Are you a native of the qing?

392
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,032
Damn, don't shout at me!

393
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,491
I'm as good as a qing.

394
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,242
Although I was born in Joseon,
I was raised in qing,

395
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,952
I speak better in mandarin.

396
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,539
It's a shame

397
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,453
that you're a Joseon Prince.

398
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,781
What?

399
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,077
Your highness?
You're worthless.

400
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,163
Your highness.

401
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,954
And mandarin doesn't suit you.
You said we're leaving!

402
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,698
Where are you going?
That's impossible.

403
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,393
Did you just call me 'worthless'?

404
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:56,284
Yes, you are not worth your title.

405
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,542
Completely worthless.

406
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,744
We got a problem!
How dare you...

407
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,991
Your highness! Please help!

408
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,662
Let's just head for the palace...

409
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,698
You're tiring me out...

410
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,208
Dol-gae!

411
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,208
Eul-ryong!

412
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,331
Dol-gae!
Deok Hee!

413
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:35,660
Dol-gae! My son!

414
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,748
Mother...

415
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,250
Honey...

416
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,120
Honey, no...

417
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,040
You must be in a great mood.

418
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,780
Your appetite is back, and
your cheeks are rosy.

419
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,453
Perhaps due to last night's festivity.

420
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:08,207
I feel so energized with warm blood.

421
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:13,365
An angel

422
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,250
visited me in my sleep.

423
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,741
Her pearly white skin

424
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:26,662
and silky hair enveloped me!

425
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,309
A fairy in a dream is a good omen.

426
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,333
Is that so?

427
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,079
Not a fairy. It was me.

428
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,365
You were inside me.

429
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,351
You were so excited to
be between my legs...

430
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,615
What did she say?

431
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,351
I'll have

432
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,911
the king's...

433
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:40,247
Kill this crazy bitch! Kill her now!

434
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,458
I kept her by my side and cared for her.

435
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,698
How dare she

436
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,323
come after

437
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,908
my life too?

438
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:12,249
Kill them! Kill them all!

439
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:19,163
Kill every traitor in my palace!

440
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,726
You dressed so well by yourself!

441
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,082
Just look at that!

442
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:57,625
Prince Ganglim!

443
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,915
Upon your return, please send help.

444
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,124
We don't know how long we'll last.

445
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:05,623
It's not just Jemulpo.

446
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:09,658
The demons will chase
the blood of others,

447
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,538
and spread to the
entire country.

448
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,208
I understand.

449
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,868
I'll talk to the king.

450
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:19,018
We'll come with you.

451
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,909
Where? To the palace? For what?

452
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:23,828
I cannot trust you.

453
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,284
We must see if you will send soldiers.

454
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:32,851
I hope you don't shun
the peasants that die before you.

455
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,617
How dare you!

456
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:39,534
Even if it's daytime, it's dangerous
for you to go by yourself.

457
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,948
Allow us to escort you.

458
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,081
Very well, follow us.

459
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,616
But if I bring an army,

460
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,036
will you come to qing with me?

461
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,206
You don't want to?

462
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:07,914
Fine, I'll go.

463
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,458
Gosh.

464
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,323
Just get through tonight.

465
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:25,990
The army will be here tomorrow.

466
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,663
Don't worry, the Prince has promised us.

467
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:32,290
Promise? I didn't promise a thing.

468
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,498
The sun will set at this rate.

469
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,206
Let's get a move on.

470
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:52,282
I'm the gatekeeper of Yanghwajin.

471
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:53,417
Prince Ganglim.

472
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:54,583
I'm aware, your highness.

473
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:57,658
I escorted you to qing.

474
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:01,073
You're really back.

475
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:07,206
You said you'd be back to
those sobbing ladies...

476
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:10,248
When did 1?

477
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,573
In any case,

478
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:18,934
bring me a boat. We're
heading to the palace.

479
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:19,958
Yes, your highness.

480
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,241
However, they cannot cross the river.

481
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,643
Why not?

482
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:28,034
I've been ordered not to let
any Jemulpo peasants in.

483
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,749
So what exactly is the reason?

484
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,914
Plague is rampant in Jemulpo.

485
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:37,655
I guess you don't know about demons yet,

486
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,532
but it's a long story.

487
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:47,247
Anyway, they're not infected,
so bring me the boat.

488
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,077
It's a royal order.

489
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:52,284
I'll get you another one.
Just get me the boat!

490
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:53,667
No, your highness.

491
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,073
Then stop me.

492
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,665
I slept and ate with them,
I must be infected too!

493
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:58,998
Your highness.

494
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:09,204
I made a promise to them.

495
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,409
You're embarrassing me in front of them.

496
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,494
They can't return to Jemulpo.

497
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:19,413
The demons will get to them
even before they reach Jemulpo.

498
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:24,786
Those demons are everywhere,
biting and sucking blood!

499
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,579
You don't believe me?
Of course, you don't.

500
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:32,948
I couldn't believe it either.

501
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:34,993
It's a royal order.

502
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,684
This guy's so uptight.

503
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,993
Unbelievable.

504
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,956
Gosh.

505
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,199
He's not worth it.

506
00:45:57,208 --> 00:46:00,245
I must go alone, so wait here.

507
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,289
Hak-su, you too.
Pardon?

508
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:06,118
Your highness!

509
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,039
Be careful of the ministers.

510
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:12,040
They won't easily give you an army.

511
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:15,393
No need for those garbage,
I'll talk to the king directly.

512
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,829
They were the ones who sent assassins.

513
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:21,329
They also led the crown Prince
to his tragic demise.

514
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,865
What do you mean?

515
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,910
He didn't commit suicide?

516
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,498
It was an unavoidable decision.

517
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,080
To save the lives of his followers
and their families,

518
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,415
he offered his own life.

519
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,703
Who do you mean?

520
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,699
Minister of war Kim Ja-joon
and his six ministers.

521
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:29,667
Burn it.

522
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:35,747
Her eyes turned gray
and teeth became sharp.

523
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,367
Aren't those the same symptoms
as the Jemulpo plague?

524
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,244
This isn't the place
to discuss the plague.

525
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:48,768
The qing envoy will arrive shortly,
make sure everything's in order.

526
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:52,956
But can his majesty receive them
with his injuries?

527
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,782
It's a royal message from the emperor.

528
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,783
It's his duty regardless of his health.

529
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,768
A messenger from the west gate arrived,

530
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,268
Jemulpo peasants demanded
that they pass through Yanghwajin.

531
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:08,204
But aren't they infected
with the plague?

532
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,619
I do not know, but among them

533
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,498
is the wanted rebel, Park Eul-ryong.

534
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,351
But how...

535
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,366
They must be eliminated.

536
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,698
Ganglim is alive.

537
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,073
He arrived with them.

538
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:47,034
Any troubles on your journey?

539
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:48,498
I had many.

540
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,207
On the way here assassins
made an attempt to kill me

541
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:55,951
and demons in Jemulpo
almost tore me to pieces.

542
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:57,792
Demons?

543
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,247
Weren't you aware?

544
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:02,999
They're like beasts
who bite human and drink their blood.

545
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,616
Their eyes are gray and
their teeth are sharp.

546
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,999
Anyone bitten will
turn into one of them.

547
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,493
How could you not know
about the chaos in Jemulpo?

548
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:18,790
I've heard that Jemulpo rebels
are spreading this rumor.

549
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,410
It is not a rumor!

550
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:24,976
Rebels cause civil unrest
by spreading vicious rumors.

551
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,786
I saw it with my own eyes!

552
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:29,577
It's an urgent matter.

553
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,207
They will reach the capital in no time.

554
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:35,375
An army must be sent immediately
and wipe out the demons.

555
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,164
What do you think, minister Kim?

556
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,323
I'll dispatch a unit of reserves.

557
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,708
Minister of war?

558
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:45,538
Yes, your highness.

559
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:52,156
The master of this court,
and all of the ministers.

560
00:49:57,042 --> 00:49:59,124
Surprised to see me alive?

561
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:08,030
Your majesty, assign me an army.

562
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,790
I'll lead it myself to Jemulpo.

563
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:12,917
Very well.

564
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:17,956
Wipe out the demons or rebels...

565
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,285
No, your majesty.

566
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:24,700
You dare to defy an order from the king?

567
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:30,325
By the way, why have you come?

568
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:32,910
To claim your brother's title?

569
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,912
Is that why you came so
swiftly after his death?

570
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,867
I'd have sent a royal order in time.

571
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,864
The king's heart is clouded,
and the good men dead.

572
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:52,530
Please take my wife and
unborn child to qing.

573
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,684
You ungrateful!

574
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:58,701
I came for the crown Princess
as per my brother's final wish.

575
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:04,160
I have no desire for the throne,
so please ease your mind.

576
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:08,079
The throne is forever yours.

577
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:13,240
As Joseon's king, please
live a long life.

578
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,619
Are you blaming me too?

579
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:19,823
Do you also think

580
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,704
I killed your brother?

581
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,373
He was my son.

582
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,412
It tore me to shreds.

583
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:32,827
And

584
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,664
Didn't...

585
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,198
Do anything to him.

586
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,750
Get out of my sight.

587
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:00,906
Not doing anything is your crime.

588
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:08,327
Leave me.

589
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,740
We will

590
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,706
overturn the world tonight.

591
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,449
Your royal highness, it's Ganglim.

592
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:57,205
A qing merchant ship
will arrive tomorrow. Be ready.

593
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:00,018
I've been dispatched to Jemulpo with...

594
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:03,455
I can't and won't go. It's all wrong.

595
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,282
This is his will.

596
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:18,158
He only thought of you
even in his final moments.

597
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:24,660
We must survive before
we can do anything else.

598
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,539
If 1 leave for qing...

599
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:40,494
Who will console
his spirit, restless and sorrowful?

600
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:45,203
I can promise you one thing.

601
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:50,531
When I'm back from Jemulpo,
I'll avenge his death.

602
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:55,575
I'll leave a trail of their blood.

603
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,323
Ganglim.

604
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:26,203
My wish to rebuild Joseon
will be left unfulfilled.

605
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:33,328
The sorrow of the people deepens,
but the king's will cannot be changed.

606
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:38,872
All his good men are buried,
leaving only the corrupt by his side.

607
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:44,034
If you were me, could you
have done differently?

608
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,285
Do me this favor.

609
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:50,542
Please

610
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,911
take my wife

611
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,373
and unborn child to qing.

612
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:10,865
What did I tell you?

613
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,415
I told you to come live with me in qing.

614
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:19,829
Leaving behind a beautiful
wife and a child.

615
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,539
What a waste.

616
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:29,991
Your highness!

617
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:33,476
I told you to wait in Yanghwajin.

618
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,643
Park and his entourage
have been arrested!

619
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,667
What?

620
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:44,324
They turned out to be the outlaw rebels!

621
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:49,202
I told you, we shouldn't
have mingled with them.

622
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,831
The king retracted his military order.

623
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,540
Why have you taken Jemulpo
peasants into custody?

624
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,198
Do you not know?

625
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:07,369
Park and his cohorts are rebels

626
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,033
who started an uprising.

627
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,288
He's a rebel for protecting the people

628
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,518
from demons?

629
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:17,542
Demons?

630
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:21,955
There aren't any. It
must only be rabies.

631
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,248
Of course, there are.

632
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,911
There's plenty right here too.

633
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:33,371
How are you any different from demons?

634
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:37,780
Even if you're the heir to the throne,

635
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:40,809
how could you accuse the ministers?

636
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:44,325
You'll take responsibility
for your words!

637
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,559
What a load of crap...

638
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:49,023
What did he say?
What did he say?

639
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:50,527
Prince Ganglim!
Prince Ganglim!

640
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:53,204
There will be a diplomatic meeting
with the qing envoys.

641
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,869
The crown Princess has been ordered
to participate.

642
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,789
Ministers, please get ready.

643
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,750
You will attend,

644
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:03,573
won't you?

645
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:14,364
Do not think that you'll
have your way again.

646
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,911
I am not like my brother.

647
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:21,747
He had things to protect, but not me.

648
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,914
Why have you returned?

649
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,495
You didn't want anything
to do with Joseon.

650
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,616
Then why have you returned?

651
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,073
It's not too late.

652
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,202
Just walk away quietly.

653
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,039
Then,

654
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,206
I'll let you live.

655
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,740
He'd like you to know.

656
00:58:13,417 --> 00:58:16,033
There was an incident yesterday morning.

657
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:20,660
A royal concubine with
rabies bit his majesty,

658
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,698
and his eyes turned red
and his skin turned pale since then.

659
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:28,366
The minister is worried

660
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:31,033
that his majesty may be infected.

661
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:54,491
King Lee of Joseon.

662
00:58:55,583 --> 00:59:00,282
Your last tribute was insultingly poor.

663
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,825
Have you forgotten your pledge?

664
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:10,580
I will generously allow
another chance to send a tribute.

665
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:12,768
Where's the royal physician?

666
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,703
Royal physician! Where are you?
Yes?

667
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,518
I heard you treated his majesty.
How is he?

668
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:20,578
The court lady must've been infected,

669
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:24,947
she went berserk during breakfast
and attacked the king.

670
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:26,393
Was he bitten?

671
00:59:26,417 --> 00:59:27,417
Yes.

672
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:29,785
I've used the Orpiment

673
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:32,039
and his condition improved.

674
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,143
Your highness! Where are you going?

675
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:37,101
To the party!

676
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:39,867
But it's late, the sun is about to set!

677
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,749
Wait for me!

678
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,226
You wait here.

679
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,786
Wait, your highness!

680
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:03,370
This is a talisman made
by a fortune teller.

681
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:04,952
I'm okay, you keep it.

682
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,768
Please!

683
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:12,786
This will protect you from evil.
Keep this with you.

684
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:21,323
It is

685
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:23,698
a joyous day.

686
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:29,531
I'd like to recite a poem
to commemorate this occasion.

687
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:35,074
The mountain is dark,
and no moon in sight,

688
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,832
leaves have fallen, and
so did the first frost.

689
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,115
Where will you go tonight,

690
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,323
a dog barks in a quaint village.

691
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,499
His majesty would like
us to have a toast,

692
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,874
please fill your glasses.

693
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,625
Cheers!

694
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:28,948
Your majesty!

695
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,535
Your majesty!

696
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:31,667
Your majesty!

697
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:32,990
Your majesty!

698
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:38,907
Your majesty!

699
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,907
Your majesty!

700
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,619
Father...

701
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:34,197
What have you done, minister?

702
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,198
He was infected with the plague

703
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,373
and turned into a demon.

704
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,824
I'm sure you all have
heard of the demons.

705
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,664
Tell us, Prince Ganglim.

706
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:57,200
You know more about the
demons than anyone here.

707
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:01,208
Is this a demon or a man?

708
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:08,143
The emperor will not condone
what happened here today!

709
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:09,373
Go tell the emperor!

710
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:10,708
Minister!

711
01:05:14,292 --> 01:05:16,624
Joseon of yesterday is finished.

712
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:21,246
The new Joseon that I'll erect
will not be the slave to qing!

713
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,823
Please, hurry. Come this way!

714
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,581
Are you all right?

715
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,159
Hold onto me. Do not let go.

716
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,333
Okay.

717
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,868
Your highness! Here!

718
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:22,828
Get to the lockup!
Yes, your highness!

719
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:39,748
Let me talk to Prince Ganglim,
then I'll tell you everything.

720
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,250
Continue!

721
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:44,997
Stop!

722
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,375
Your highness.

723
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,698
The palace is overrun with demons!

724
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,207
Your highness! The demons!

725
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:57,824
I'm sure you've heard
rumors about demons.

726
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,539
They're all true.

727
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,573
He is not a man but a demon.

728
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:06,039
Gather all royal guards in the palace.

729
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:08,828
If we do not stop them,
the palace is finished.

730
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,059
But without a royal order...

731
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,198
The king is dead.

732
01:08:14,208 --> 01:08:17,325
Your highness, the gates
must be secured first.

733
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,268
If they leave the palace,
the capital will fall!

734
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:22,453
Dispatch the royal guards
around the palace walls!

735
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,309
Not one demon can leave the palace!

736
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:28,333
Yes, your highness!

737
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,332
Where's everyone?
They're locked up.

738
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,365
Quick, close the gates!

739
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,125
What are those?

740
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:55,167
It's the plague...

741
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,616
What... what are those?

742
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,244
Cover the door.
Yes, sir!

743
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:03,458
This way.

744
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,198
Free everyone.

745
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,455
Eul-ryong!

746
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:13,018
Is everyone okay?
Yes.

747
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:14,122
Quickly free everyone.

748
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:15,583
Yes, sir!

749
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,411
This is Park Hyun, I trained with him.

750
01:09:23,042 --> 01:09:24,498
He can be trusted.

751
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,995
Please kill me, your highness...

752
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:45,282
Maintain formation!

753
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:48,518
Not a single demon shall
leave the palace!

754
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,203
Understood?
Yes, sir!

755
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:59,206
This all started because of
a foreign merchant ship.

756
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:04,364
I told the minister of
war about the ship.

757
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,324
He was threatening

758
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,706
my family's life...

759
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,955
No, he's the devil. He must be beheaded.

760
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,115
What did he say?

761
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:28,655
He must be killed before
a disaster arrives.

762
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:34,956
Do you mean Kim Ja-joon knew about it?

763
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:37,623
The ship and the demons?

764
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,243
It's all over.

765
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,163
And

766
01:10:45,042 --> 01:10:46,202
this is only the beginning.

767
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,491
It doesn't matter if there
are thousands of them.

768
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:51,873
We have enough guns and gunpowder,

769
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:55,705
we'll get the reserves
to wipe them out upon sunrise.

770
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,456
Everyone's dead.

771
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,949
The king and the royal blood.

772
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:05,268
Who should spearhead a new country?

773
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:08,125
Do you mean a revolution? But...

774
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:10,498
That's treason.

775
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,831
No, it's a dawn of a new world.

776
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,949
This country doesn't
belong to king Lee's lineage.

777
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:33,197
You all have talked about a new world.

778
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,241
Without any change, Joseon will fall,

779
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:40,663
but with the same lineage in place,
what can change?

780
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,744
Now is the time.

781
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,498
With the country in ruins,

782
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:50,032
I will raise a new country,

783
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:53,749
and you'll all become
its founding ministers.

784
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:03,497
Prince Ganglim

785
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:06,994
could still be alive.

786
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:10,198
Joseon's heritage

787
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:14,822
can only be carried on by his lineage!

788
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,952
Minister!
My lord!

789
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:23,704
I did not ask you about right and wrong.

790
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:25,823
That is up to me

791
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,914
to decide now.

792
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,785
Make up your mind.

793
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:34,873
Will you join me,

794
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,161
or get buried

795
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,411
with a dead dynasty?

796
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,198
Defend the left flank!

797
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:07,494
The inner gate! Protect the inner gate!

798
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:28,578
Do not fall back!

799
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,833
Anyone retreating will be punished!

800
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:49,993
Your highness!

801
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,198
Help!

802
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,415
Hak-su, hurry! Over here!

803
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:56,165
This door won't hold!

804
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:03,078
Hurry!

805
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,615
Open the window!
Yes, sir!

806
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:25,203
Out of the way. Tie this to both ends!

807
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:33,955
Hurry!

808
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,039
Get out!

809
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:16,958
Eul-ryong!

810
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:18,953
Hurry, your highness!

811
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,994
Hurry! Park!

812
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,491
Park!

813
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:09,407
Are you all right?

814
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,990
Finally, a new world.

815
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:47,496
The 200 royal guards likely
fought off the demon wave.

816
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:51,200
The rest can be killed in the day.

817
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,809
Go to Yanghwajin and
bring back the reserves.

818
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,369
As you wish, minister Kim.

819
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:59,158
I mean, your majesty.

820
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,208
Scour the palace and find

821
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:05,327
Ganglim and the crown Princess.

822
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,207
He's tenacious. He
should still be alive.

823
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:43,873
Who else was bitten?

824
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,865
Minister...

825
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:50,833
Your hand...

826
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,535
Minister,

827
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:06,659
we need to start all over again,
about this new world.

828
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:10,375
About...

829
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:12,726
Who will take the throne.

830
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:13,750
Wait.

831
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,101
The infection can be
stopped if I cut my arm.

832
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:18,160
Calm down.

833
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:20,744
You're being stubborn.

834
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,458
You'll die

835
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:24,123
anyway.

836
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,208
Minister.

837
01:19:57,458 --> 01:19:58,458
Minister.

838
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,244
When you are born again...

839
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,619
Please do not be a king.

840
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:44,538
Have you found Kim?

841
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:46,167
Not yet...

842
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,082
He couldn't have survived last night.

843
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,953
He's either dead or turned into a demon.

844
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:53,327
Find him.

845
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:54,792
Be it a body

846
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,750
or a demon.

847
01:21:57,333 --> 01:22:00,575
There were about 500 demons last night.

848
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,166
Even more will attack
the palace tonight.

849
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:06,323
You must call the reserves.

850
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:12,623
Please kill me.

851
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:19,992
You're the only one
who can mobilize the reserves.

852
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,249
Go to Yanghwajin and bring them here.

853
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,074
Rest of you, escort him to Yanghwajin.

854
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,367
If he turns before then,
kill him at once.

855
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:33,790
They'll believe you
if they see a demon in the flesh.

856
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,328
Will you accept this mission?

857
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,042
Yes, your highness.

858
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,535
Prince Ganglim.

859
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:52,074
Reaching Yanghwajin is not the problem.

860
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,458
The reserves cannot reach her by sunset.

861
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,947
Gather the survivors.
We'll leave the palace at once.

862
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:06,282
If the demons climb these walls,
it's all over for Joseon.

863
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,242
Then that is Joseon's fate.

864
01:23:11,042 --> 01:23:12,282
Is there another way?

865
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,830
I cannot leave.

866
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:16,081
No, I won't leave.

867
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,434
Princess...

868
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,744
Must we abandon this
place to save ourselves?

869
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,533
How are you any different
from the last king?

870
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,664
I am not a king.

871
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,101
The crown Prince wouldn't do this.

872
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,456
He's dead!

873
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:35,726
I'm not asking you to take the throne!

874
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,615
Just save the innocent people.

875
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:42,116
Find a way.

876
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,698
That is your duty.

877
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,994
Will you come to qing

878
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,289
once demons are dealt with?

879
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:42,999
So the gunpowder was brought here?

880
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,750
Yes.

881
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,042
Then

882
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,366
the fire tactic is the only option.

883
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:52,574
We lure the demons to one
spot and light a fire.

884
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,697
Park, move the drum to the royal villa.

885
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:59,073
Hurry!
Yes, sir!

886
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:01,833
Monk,

887
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:05,700
gather and plant dry
branches and resins.

888
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:09,955
The rest of you, gather oil pots
and spray around the villa.

889
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:11,327
Make it very flammable.

890
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:15,434
Also, lock all doors so
that demons can't escape,

891
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,574
and make the walls flammable as well.

892
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,161
The demons must be held inside.

893
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,912
I created this new world.

894
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:37,828
Do not forget.

895
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,539
I am the king

896
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,706
of new Joseon.

897
01:27:41,667 --> 01:27:42,667
Over here.

898
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:46,782
Keep an eye out here.

899
01:27:46,917 --> 01:27:50,080
Where's the talisman?

900
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,115
Be careful.

901
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:00,953
Gather the gunpowder.

902
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:12,373
I'll check inside too.

903
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:18,625
Monk!

904
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:43,869
Oh no...

905
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:45,583
Your highness!

906
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,535
Park hyun!

907
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,750
Park Hyun!

908
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:01,368
Go upstairs!

909
01:30:03,542 --> 01:30:04,952
Get out!

910
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,250
You go first!

911
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,893
Your highness!
Hurry!

912
01:30:12,917 --> 01:30:14,157
Your highness!
Go!

913
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,115
Your highness! Hurry!

914
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:19,369
Hak-su, get out! Now!

915
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,865
Your highness! Please hurry!

916
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:39,375
Your highness...

917
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:49,952
Hak-su.

918
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:51,667
Your highness!

919
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:57,997
Where's Hak-su?

920
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:00,285
Your highness!

921
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,583
Your highness!

922
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:21,615
Prince Ganglim!
Hak-su!

923
01:31:35,917 --> 01:31:37,908
Just go...

924
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,247
Go...

925
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:44,749
No, your highness! It's too late.

926
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,574
Always think before you act...

927
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:50,208
Don't lose

928
01:31:50,417 --> 01:31:52,282
the talisman.

929
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,036
Watch out for dog shit

930
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,535
on the street.

931
01:31:58,667 --> 01:31:59,873
Hak-su, no...

932
01:32:00,417 --> 01:32:01,657
Your highness...

933
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:16,792
Hak-su!

934
01:32:17,417 --> 01:32:18,577
Hak-su!

935
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,285
Hak-su!

936
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,867
Hak-su! No!

937
01:32:30,417 --> 01:32:32,032
No!

938
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:33,833
No!

939
01:32:58,375 --> 01:33:00,616
It's getting dark, we must hurry.

940
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:06,619
This is the last batch!
Take it outside.

941
01:33:37,792 --> 01:33:39,532
Princess, get away!

942
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,039
Get the gunpowder inside!

943
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:57,493
Get the gunpowder.

944
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:01,123
Man-Bo!
Are you okay?

945
01:34:02,542 --> 01:34:03,542
Man-Bo!

946
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:13,330
Go inside, this is the
end of the line for me.

947
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:16,283
I cannot go inside.

948
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:18,365
Please hurry!

949
01:34:18,542 --> 01:34:19,542
Hurry!

950
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:22,559
Your royal highness!

951
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,039
Hurry!
Bring her inside.

952
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:57,414
I want to

953
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:01,623
die as a man.

954
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:07,203
I beg to you,

955
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:09,833
monk.

956
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:11,750
Please.

957
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:13,417
No.

958
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:25,704
Man-Bo, do not

959
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,491
return to this world.

960
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:33,868
May Buddha grace upon you.

961
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:44,623
Man-Bo...

962
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:47,118
No.

963
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,250
The sun will set soon.

964
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:16,123
It's almost time.

965
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:19,124
Take the crown Princess
and leave the palace.

966
01:36:19,917 --> 01:36:21,373
I'll stay behind to light the fire.

967
01:36:21,625 --> 01:36:22,865
I'll stay back.

968
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:24,410
No, I'll stay.

969
01:36:25,542 --> 01:36:27,032
You all leave now.

970
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,330
I'm staying.

971
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:33,851
Escort the crown Princess to Yanghwajin.

972
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:36,366
No, your highness. You must stay alive.

973
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,198
I don't plan on dying.

974
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:43,323
I'll light the fire and join you.

975
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,161
After burning these demons.

976
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:56,618
I was bitten during the skirmish.

977
01:36:57,167 --> 01:37:00,659
It's near the heart,
so I'll start turning shortly.

978
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,500
Bloody hell...

979
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:08,282
May Buddha grace upon you.

980
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,787
I should be able to hold out
until I light the fire.

981
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:14,583
Eul-ryong...

982
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,500
It's okay, Deok Hee.

983
01:37:17,167 --> 01:37:18,828
We all die once.

984
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:24,157
Will you leave for qing?

985
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:29,203
I hope you come back.

986
01:37:31,125 --> 01:37:33,411
Rebuild this palace

987
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:37,245
and Joseon when you do.

988
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:39,373
I said I don't want to!

989
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:44,495
You keep saying that
but got here this far.

990
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,581
I didn't come here to be a king.

991
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:53,205
I came to bring back you pitiful souls.

992
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:57,866
No one took pity on us.

993
01:38:00,042 --> 01:38:02,704
No one tried to save us.

994
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:07,453
No one ever heard our cries.

995
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:12,789
But you did.

996
01:38:15,875 --> 01:38:17,661
Isn't that the duty of the king?

997
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:21,705
Now that

998
01:38:22,958 --> 01:38:24,573
I've met the king,

999
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,161
I can die peacefully.

1000
01:38:30,417 --> 01:38:33,204
Bullshit...

1001
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:35,615
Eul-ryong...

1002
01:38:36,833 --> 01:38:37,833
Eul-ryong...

1003
01:38:49,292 --> 01:38:50,498
Everyone, out.

1004
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,664
I'll bang the drum in 15 minutes.

1005
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:58,407
Your highness!

1006
01:41:54,792 --> 01:41:55,792
Your highness!

1007
01:41:58,708 --> 01:42:00,869
Where are you going?

1008
01:42:06,792 --> 01:42:09,033
Princess, go on ahead.

1009
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,911
I'll light the villa and come back.

1010
01:42:11,333 --> 01:42:12,368
But Prince Ganglim...

1011
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,365
I will go.

1012
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:16,039
This is my duty.

1013
01:42:18,625 --> 01:42:19,705
And you.

1014
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:22,914
Don't wait for anyone.

1015
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:26,457
No one will come to save you.

1016
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,948
You must save yourselves.

1017
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:32,368
Save this country

1018
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:35,868
and choose your king.

1019
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:40,831
Bloody hell.

1020
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:42,827
There are so many...

1021
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:42,995
Come back, crown Prince.

1022
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:46,947
A king precedes the people...

1023
01:46:35,917 --> 01:46:36,917
Excuse me.

1024
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:38,667
Deok Hee!

1025
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:45,625
Damn it!

1026
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:36,448
Damn!

1027
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:43,288
Let's end this.

1028
01:51:47,292 --> 01:51:49,157
Joseon is finished.

1029
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:55,833
Die,

1030
01:51:57,167 --> 01:51:59,203
son of a perished country.

1031
01:54:03,958 --> 01:54:05,038
Aim!

1032
01:54:06,458 --> 01:54:07,698
Fire!

1033
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:42,292
Park,

1034
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:45,038
do you see this?

1035
01:54:47,667 --> 01:54:48,782
It's the people.

1036
01:54:53,583 --> 01:54:55,995
The king precedes the people?

1037
01:54:58,083 --> 01:54:59,368
You're wrong.

1038
01:55:02,083 --> 01:55:06,122
The people precedes the king.

1039
01:55:30,875 --> 01:55:32,035
I'm sorry.

1040
01:55:34,542 --> 01:55:36,282
I came back too late.

1041
01:56:29,208 --> 01:56:30,288
Where are you, father?

1042
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:43,493
Dol-gae.

1043
01:56:58,333 --> 01:57:02,406
Look! It's the crown Prince!
He's coming for us
