3
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,625
Don't you worry.

4
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,875
I promised your mother

5
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,125
that I would love and take care of you

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,375
because I love you.

7
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,875
I used to be the guy next door.

8
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,125
But from now on,

9
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,917
we will live under the same roof.

10
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,708
Tid Noi!

11
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:25,958
My dear Mak…

12
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,583
Where did you take my beloved?

13
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:37,167
Stop, Yong.

14
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,208
Those are just words

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,167
claiming that she's your lover.

16
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,958
-Anybody can say that.
-I don't understand

17
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,375
why he hung himself.

18
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,708
I want to know what he was thinking.

19
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,958
Folks!

20
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,792
The story is getting really intense.

21
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,500
In this scene,
you'll see our beautiful protagonist,

22
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,375
sweet as honey.

23
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:13,167
Give it up for Pawana!

24
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,417
I pray that she is beautiful.

25
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,583
Alright, then.

26
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:22,000
Damn, she's a shortie!

27
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,083
Whoa.

28
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,625
Oh, wow.

29
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,917
She is so pretty.

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,958
Pretty?

31
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,875
I don't think she's prettier than me.

32
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,458
Look at the guy she's with.

33
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,417
His face looks like dog poop.

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,542
Nak, let's find a spot.

35
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,792
Come on. Go with him!

36
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,292
-Hey.
-Hey.

37
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,375
Oh.

38
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,333
Can we sit here?

39
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,625
Payak, what are you doing?

40
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,833
Pee Yong is my lover.

41
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,125
Hold on, Mayom.

42
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,667
Between a shoddy temple boy…

43
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,208
and a chieftain's son,
who will you choose?

44
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:33,417
Fine. If you want me to choose,

45
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,417
I choose Pee Yong.

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,542
Mak,

47
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,958
come and sit here.

48
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Mayom, don't be afraid.

49
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,500
-Tid Noi.
-Don't give in.

50
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,875
Yes?

51
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,708
Can you move up there?

52
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,333
Whatever you want,

53
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,375
I'll always do it for you.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
-I choose Yong. I don't want you.
-Fine.

55
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,208
Although he is poor, I love him.

56
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,167
You two are so much in love,

57
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,792
just go to hell together!

58
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,500
The story is getting exciting.

59
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,792
Who will get Mayom as his wife?

60
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,708
Continue watching.

61
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:17,875
Here we go.

62
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,375
Mayom.

63
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,458
Mayom.

64
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,750
Why did you make me vow
that I wouldn't remarry?

65
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,542
Why did you make me vow?

66
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,417
Even after you die,
you still ruin my life.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,167
Damn you! Damn you!

68
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,375
Damn.

69
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,167
They always fight at every festival.

70
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,542
-This way.
-This way.

71
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,458
Mak, I'm scared of ghosts.

72
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:02,458
It's just a corpse, not a ghost.

73
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,917
It's the same. I'm scared.

74
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,917
You are scared of a corpse this much.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,250
When you see a real ghost,

76
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,250
won't you drop dead, Nak?

77
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,708
Oi, Mak.

78
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,792
I saw that you ran away first.

79
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,917
Nak, from now on,

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,167
I give you my word,

81
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,583
that no matter what happens,

82
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,042
I will never leave you.

83
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,500
Me too.

84
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,708
Oh, damn!

85
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,708
Let's go!

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,917
You said you wouldn't leave me?

87
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,625
It's so cute.

88
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:58,250
Damn, this is spooky. Wait for me.

89
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,167
Here we are.

90
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,542
Thank you, Tid Noi.

91
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,333
Pee Mak.

92
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,625
I should go inside.

93
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,875
-Yes.
-Yes.

94
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,292
Here.

95
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,375
Mak.

96
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,917
What?

97
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,833
If you want to talk about Nak,
we can talk tomorrow. I'm sleepy.

98
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,375
Gotta go.

99
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,000
I surely talk to you about Nak,

100
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,750
but there is also something important.

101
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,875
What?

102
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:46,458
Can you walk me home?

103
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:50,875
Where is your house?

104
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,167
There it is.

105
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,750
Here?

106
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,458
Right here?

107
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,542
TID NOI

108
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,125
Whoa, a ghoul!

109
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,000
A ghoul, my ass! A gay!

110
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,417
Duang,

111
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,875
why are you here so late?

112
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,958
I caught some eels.

113
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,417
I will make you soup tomorrow.

114
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,500
Next time you come around,

115
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,000
better give a shout-out.

116
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:45,958
Can I stay here tonight?

117
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,958
Well, you brought your pillow.

118
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:50,542
Alright, then.

119
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,292
But don't be naughty.

120
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,458
Put the lantern there.

121
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,583
So hot in here.

122
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,583
Get some sleep.

123
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
Ah, so hot.

124
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,333
I said don't be naughty!

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,417
No, Duang.

126
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,375
DON'T FORGET TO EAT EEL SOUP. DUANG

127
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,167
Eel soup.

128
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,750
-Ma'am.
-Hey, Tid Noi.

129
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:14,042
I made you eel soup.

130
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,583
Thank you, darling.

131
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,583
You brought us this soup,

132
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,417
but why do you have a long face like that?

133
00:09:23,042 --> 00:09:24,875
I'm worried it won't taste good.

134
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,167
I'm sure it will.

135
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,500
It's Nak's favorite.

136
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,042
So, you woke up early to find eels.

137
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,375
You were just running away
from a ghost last night.

138
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,917
Nah, I was just pretending
that I was scared.

139
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,708
If I was scared,
I wouldn't go out to catch an eel for you.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,042
You really work hard, Tid Noi.

141
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,333
You get up early to cook.

142
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,083
It's really hard to find someone like you.

143
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,375
Anyone who lives with me
will have such a good life.

144
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,667
I'm wondering if someone around here

145
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,292
wants to have a good life at all.

146
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,250
Of course,
everybody wants to have a good life.

147
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,917
She won't have to paddle
to the market herself.

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,333
Isn't that right, Mom?

149
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,542
How is it going? Caught a lot of fish?

150
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,208
Not bad.

151
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,542
Where are you off to?

152
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,750
I'm taking my sweetheart to the market.

153
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,083
Where are you going, Tid Noi?

154
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,917
I'm taking Nak to the market.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,333
Are you jealous?

156
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,958
Hey, Nak. Why are you rushing?

157
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,708
Nak!

158
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,250
-Okay.
-Wow.

159
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,083
Be careful.

160
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,458
-What do you have for sale?
-Fermented fish.

161
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,208
-I make it myself.
-You made this?

162
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,750
-That's right.
-Would you like some?

163
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,417
I know how to make it.

164
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,167
Want some noodles?

165
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,125
It smells so nice.

166
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,625
We can come back later.

167
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,875
MAMA MALA RICE NOODLES

168
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:13,958
Nak.

169
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,583
Here,

170
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,875
do you know how to pick fresh fish?

171
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,292
It's easy.

172
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,917
Shiny scales,

173
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,875
clear eyes,

174
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:25,958
and pink gills.

175
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,375
Which one should I get?

176
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,083
Only aphrodisiac stuff,

177
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,375
nothing for a wife beater?

178
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,083
Damn.

179
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,917
This freeloader.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,083
Foon.

181
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,375
-Hey.
-Oh,

182
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,833
you are almost sold out today.

183
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,792
Nah, I drank almost all of it.

184
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,417
Do you want some?

185
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,167
Not for me.

186
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,625
-No?
-Nope.

187
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,792
-Abdul.
-Oi.

188
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,917
-Women know.
-I do.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,167
-Men know.
-I do.

190
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,667
Some may be skeptical.

191
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,750
You don't believe?

192
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,375
-What's this kid's hairstyle?
-Top knot.

193
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,917
Whoa!

194
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,417
Abdul knows everything

195
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,708
because of...

196
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:14,875
the enchantment potion.

197
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,250
Women fall in love, men fall in love,

198
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,750
enemies become friends.

199
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,292
Here are the last ten bottles.

200
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,833
Hey, I'll take them all.

201
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,458
Ten tamleung.

202
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,917
Is it sold out?

203
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,583
I want some.
Someone may fall in love with me.

204
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,125
Here, here, alright.

205
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,125
Here are the last ten bottles, really.

206
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,208
Have you chosen?

207
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,000
Not yet.

208
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,333
I am not talking about the fish.

209
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,000
What is it, then?

210
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,458
I'm talking about your man.

211
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,458
Is it Tid Noi?

212
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,500
Silly you.

213
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,667
-Hey. Hey. Hey.
-Hey. Hey. Hey.

214
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,792
-Hey!
-Be careful.

215
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,458
Don't fight.

216
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,417
Kratom leaves! Every single leave
gives you energy. Want some?

217
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,125
-Not for me.
-Get lost, then.

218
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,375
Kratom leaves!

219
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,750
--Good for sunlight resistance.
-Hey.

220
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,375
Hell. My name is Mak.

221
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,625
This is Nak.

222
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,458
Oh! Amazing.

223
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,792
Photo! Camera! It's a camera.

224
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
What is a camera?

225
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,000
Here. Here. Here. Come here.

226
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,208
Stand here.

227
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,917
And smile.

228
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,250
One more time.

229
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,583
Honey, please watch the shop.

230
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,875
I'll take a shit.

231
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,125
What?

232
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,250
-Pee Mak.
-Yes.

233
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll be back.

234
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,125
Where are you off to?

235
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,125
Take a shit.

236
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,750
What did she say? Something about shit?

237
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,250
Tid Noi, it's the southern dialect.

238
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,875
Take a dump, take a shit.

239
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,708
You don't know anything.

240
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,500
Is Nak a southerner?

241
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,958
Ouch.

242
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,417
Where are you going?

243
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,250
Hey!

244
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,750
-No! Let me go! Let me go.
-Don't move.

245
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,125
You want to take a dump?

246
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,375
Before you pull out,
how about you put it in?

247
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,583
Help. Mak.

248
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,708
-Nak!
-I'm here!

249
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,875
-What are you doing?
-You all know that Nak is my woman.

250
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,417
Hey, there is a rumor

251
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,208
that Nak is Mak's wife, isn't she?

252
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:17,625
Don't say that. You bring disgrace to Nak.

253
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,917
How about when you said Nak is your wife?

254
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,875
You didn't bring her disgrace?

255
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,250
I don't care who she is with,

256
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,083
but today, she has to be my wife.

257
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,792
Mak, take Nak home.

258
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,750
-Go.
-Go. Go.

259
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,250
Okay.

260
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,125
-Come on.
-He must be an ex-boxer.

261
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,500
Quick feet Noi.

262
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,667
Hey.

263
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,500
Hurry up, Nak. Come in.

264
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,375
We are safe now.

265
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,125
How about Tid Noi?

266
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Hey.

267
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,167
So girly.

268
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,042
Don't worry about him.

269
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,167
He knows boxing.

270
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,208
Thank you for saving me, Mak.

271
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,333
Did you get hurt anywhere?

272
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:21,542
Hey!

273
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,292
It doesn't hurt.

274
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,208
You are here.

275
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,708
How could I feel pain?

276
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,333
Hey.

277
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,917
So girly, son of a gun!

278
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,500
-Take him!
-Hey!

279
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,917
Tid Noi!

280
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,917
Are you alright?

281
00:17:56,417 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you so much.

282
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:00,208
Are you hurt?

283
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,125
Not at all.

284
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:06,792
Worth it.

285
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:09,333
Right.

286
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,542
Poor you.

287
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,625
Tid Noi.

288
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,208
Thank you so much.

289
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:22,375
If it weren't for you,
Nak would be violated.

290
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,125
She is already violated, Mom.

291
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you mean?

292
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,833
Nak and I got intimate.

293
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:40,375
I'm bringing flowers
and incense to apologize.

294
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,125
When did it happen?

295
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,042
Yesterday.

296
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,708
Thank you so much.

297
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,208
It must have been for my good deed,

298
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,000
-Are you hurt?
-that's why she hugged me.

299
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,917
Well, since it already happened,

300
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,542
you will have to ask for my blessing.

301
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,625
Yes.

302
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,708
Well…

303
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,708
What do you think about the dowry?

304
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,667
Hundred tamleung, then.

305
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:28,042
I will have to go to Bangkok
to earn money for the dowry.

306
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,958
-Thank you.
-Right.

307
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,958
By the way, where is Nak?

308
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,667
She said she'll pick mushrooms
behind the haystack.

309
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,833
-I have to go now.
-Yes.

310
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,833
-No, people will see us.
-Nobody will see us.

311
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,417
Nak.

312
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,083
Hmm?

313
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,208
Do this.

314
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,583
I love you, Nak.

315
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,833
This ring represents my love.

316
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,625
Keep it with you.

317
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,125
I will keep it until the day I die.

318
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,083
Nak.

319
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,792
Nak.

320
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,708
Nak.

321
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,250
Nak.

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,083
Nak.

323
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:01,208
Nak. Where is she?

324
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,042
Nak.

325
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:10,917
Nak.

326
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,583
Where is she?

327
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,083
What the hell?

328
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,250
Can he really not see us?

329
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Can't he really?

330
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,250
I wonder.

331
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,458
We were just here. How couldn't he see us?

332
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,208
No, not in front of the buffaloes.

333
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,583
They don't know anything.

334
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,208
Tid Noi, what are you doing here?

335
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:56,333
I'm here to tell you
that I will go to Pranakorn tomorrow.

336
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,250
Why do you have to go?

337
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,500
-To work, for the future.
-That's great.

338
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,125
Don't forget us Prakanongs
when you get rich.

339
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,333
I won't forget even when I'm poor.

340
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:12,583
Did it take you the whole day
to pick mushrooms?

341
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,083
Are you free tomorrow?

342
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,417
I want you to go to the temple with me.

343
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,708
I'm busy tomorrow.

344
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,917
Why are you smiling?

345
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:32,250
Nak is busy tomorrow.

346
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,583
Why is that?

347
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:35,125
She must be sending me off.

348
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,208
Why don't you know anything?

349
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,708
Tid Noi, will you go now?

350
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

351
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,542
Nak.

352
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,167
You didn't come to send me off
because you were afraid you'd cry, right?

353
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,625
Let's go.

354
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,792
Be careful.

355
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,250
PRANAKORN

356
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,375
Where are you going?

357
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,125
Going home, I guess.

358
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:54,750
To the temple.

359
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,667
Get on, please.

360
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,583
Thank you, young man.

361
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,917
You earn good karma.

362
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:28,333
Luang Por, I don't want good karma,

363
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:30,625
I want a wife.

364
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,458
Will you pay me, please?

365
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:35,792
All right.

366
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,125
To Bangkok Noi, please.

367
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,917
Alright, get on.

368
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,792
Bless you.

369
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,917
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

370
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,458
-Here we are.
-Stop. Stop. Stop.

371
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,917
Hey, bro, you are really smooth.

372
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,042
Hey, if you are not in a rush,

373
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,833
-wait for me.
-Yes.

374
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,625
I'm here to pick up my wife.
She works up there.

375
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,917
-There she is.
-There you are, Somchai.

376
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,292
Yes, honey.

377
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,750
-Are you tired?
-Not at all.

378
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,167
Shall we head home?

379
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,333
Just one more customer, honey.

380
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,625
I see. One more.

381
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,458
Let's go.

382
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,083
-Gotta go to work.
-Yes, keep it up.

383
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,625
I'll wait for you.

384
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,208
That's my wife.

385
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,917
She works here.

386
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,917
I'm still so proud of myself

387
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,458
that I have a good wife,
a good married life.

388
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,333
She works hard.

389
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,458
Rough, gentle,

390
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,458
small, big, short, long, work.

391
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,833
She takes it all.

392
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,750
I don't want to brag

393
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,333
that I am doing quite well

394
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:24,542
because of my wife.

395
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,833
You have to find a wife like mine.

396
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,542
That you can show off to anyone.

397
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,542
-I see.
-Yeah.

398
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,042
It seems to be taking a long time.

399
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:36,208
You can go back now.

400
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,042
Keep the change. Take it.

401
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,125
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

402
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:51,417
NAIMAI COFFEE SHOP

403
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,750
Hey, brother.

404
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,708
Oh, you can speak Thai.

405
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,667
Of course I can.

406
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,458
Where are you from?

407
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:10,792
Africa.

408
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:14,000
I see. Have you been here long?

409
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:17,500
-Two…
-Two years?

410
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,250
Two days.

411
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,167
You learned to speak Thai in two days?

412
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:23,333
I'm well educated.

413
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,792
-Do you have a car?
-Of course.

414
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,083
-Bicycle?
-Yes.

415
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:28,875
-Snake?
-I do.

416
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,667
Slither or walk?

417
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,083
Fly, I guess?

418
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:35,042
In my homeland, I have everything.

419
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:37,542
-The only thing I don't have…
-What is it?

420
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,500
My homeland doesn't have a guy like you.

421
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,208
-Where do you want to go?
-To the brothel.

422
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,417
Brohotel?

423
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,208
Brothel.

424
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:52,958
Oh, I see.

425
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,458
Here we are.

426
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:07,875
Why didn't you tell me it's here,
only two steps away?

427
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,750
If I told you, how would I make money?

428
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,625
That's why I told you
that I have everything in my homeland,

429
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,458
and the only thing that I don't have

430
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,792
is someone like you.

431
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,792
Greedy bastard.

432
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:22,792
Here!

433
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:27,333
And stay away from me or I'll kick you.

434
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:28,500
Go!

435
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,417
To Golden Mountain, please.

436
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,792
Please, get on.

437
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,458
Keep it up!

438
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,125
For Nak!

439
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,542
Nak, help me!

440
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,958
Nak!

441
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,583
What?

442
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,292
Your dad is very handsome?

443
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,833
Will our son be handsome like his dad?

444
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,250
Do you want some?

445
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,500
Poor Tid Noi.

446
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:57,958
It's too late now.

447
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,417
I feel sorry for you.

448
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,958
Mak made her moves quickly.

449
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,417
Hundred tamleung.

450
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,167
Nak.

451
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,208
-Hey.
-Oh.

452
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,667
Do you want a lot of money?

453
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't want a lot of money,

454
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,583
I want lots of money.

455
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:44,708
Damn, it's the same.

456
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,000
I don't like a lot of money.
I like lots of money.

457
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,208
Yeah, lots then.

458
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,167
If you want lots of money,

459
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,292
why don't you do what I do?

460
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:54,958
Let your wife work.

461
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,292
You stay home and take the money.

462
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,417
That's a man's ultimate happiness.

463
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:03,500
Why are you saving lots of money?

464
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,250
-To marry a woman.
-I see.

465
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,542
Are you crazy?

466
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,125
Why do you want to marry a woman?

467
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,917
How did you come up with this idea?

468
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,333
Getting married is only a waste of money.

469
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,458
Get married, then spend
a lifetime being afraid of her.

470
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,833
If you were my brother,
I'd kick you in the face.

471
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,083
What a moron.

472
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:24,917
Come on. Take me. I'll pick up my wife.

473
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,792
Getting married? You moron.

474
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,542
What a tool.

475
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:31,583
Go!

476
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,708
Nak.

477
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:44,125
Yes.

478
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,375
Please be mine.

479
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,917
Yes, Tid Noi.

480
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,208
Let me kiss you.

481
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,625
So refreshing.

482
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,917
Yes.

483
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,500
Can you sound sweeter?

484
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,417
What the hell is this?

485
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't know Nak.

486
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,167
Will you screw me?
If you won't screw me, then buzz off.

487
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,000
Yeah. I'll screw you.

488
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,583
Ouch.

489
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,042
That hurts!

490
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:12,958
My name means small,

491
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,417
but my thing is quite big.

492
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,208
Idiot, that's my butthole.

493
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,542
Try again.

494
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:24,667
-Ouch. Same hole.
-Dammit.

495
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,208
Come on.

496
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,000
Allow me. Go.

497
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,458
-Lie down.
-What the hell?

498
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,208
Come here.

499
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Such a waste of my time.

500
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,000
Ow!

501
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,333
-What is it?
-I like it.

502
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,042
Now you are talking.

503
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,542
Let's continue then.

504
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,375
Enough.

505
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,250
-That's enough.
-Just one more.

506
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,583
No. No more.

507
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,083
-Stay still.
-No more.

508
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,167
Here, it's for free.

509
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,333
Enough.

510
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:57,042
I finished.

511
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,542
Enough.

512
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,083
Here is your money. I'm leaving.

513
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,000
Man, she's scary.

514
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:07,750
Please come back.

515
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,042
Next.

516
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:42,875
It's done.

517
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:49,458
Luang Por, is this a tattoo or surgery?

518
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,417
Of course, it's a tattoo.

519
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,625
Oh, it's you.

520
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,625
What tattoo do you want?

521
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,250
Yantra of Eight Directions,

522
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,500
nine stupas,

523
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,375
invincibility,

524
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,250
or enchantment?

525
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,083
None of those.

526
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,875
What is it?

527
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,542
Nak.

528
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,375
This must be your wedding, Nak.

529
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,917
Why did you hug me that day?

530
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:19,375
The 100 tamleung is useless.

531
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,542
Nak.

532
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,542
Nak.

533
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:42,458
Tid Noi.

534
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

535
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,917
Nak.

536
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:48,708
I'm back.

537
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,708
Tid Noi.

538
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,792
Nak.

539
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,500
Do you have painkillers?

540
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,625
Get me some.

541
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:35,792
Nak.

542
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,125
Don't worry.

543
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:51,625
I promised your mother
that I would love you

544
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:56,417
and take care of you because I love you.

545
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:02,708
If you don't believe me, Nak,
look at this.

546
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:07,375
DEAR NAK

547
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:14,875
Back then, I was the guy next door.

548
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:20,208
From now on,
we will live under the same roof.

549
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:27,208
Tid Noi, I love Mak.

550
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:30,667
Nak, say that again.

551
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,458
I love Mak.

552
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,667
I love you much, Nak.

553
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,583
Tid Noi.

554
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,667
Listen carefully.

555
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,583
I love Mak!

556
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,333
How flattering.

557
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,250
You love me much,

558
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:48,958
and I love you much.

559
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,833
Nak, whose ring is this?

560
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,167
Nak.

561
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:00,292
Nak.

562
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,375
The ceremony is about to begin. Let's go.

563
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,458
Wait.

564
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,375
Mak.

565
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,875
You remember this.

566
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:18,792
From now on, you'll never leave Nak.

567
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,583
And one more thing.

568
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:26,833
If she doesn't want something,
never force it on her.

569
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,417
Understood?

570
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:30,958
Yes.

571
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:36,458
Don't you want to join the ceremony?

572
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,208
I've been to many ceremonies already.

573
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,250
Let's go.

574
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:47,667
And another thing.

575
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,542
She likes eel soup.

576
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,250
She has breakfast at 5:30.

577
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,083
Remember that.

578
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,333
I take your silence
as a promise you give me, Mak.

579
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:01,708
Now, you can go.

580
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,667
Please accept the blessing.

581
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:48,375
Alright.

582
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,583
Listen to the blessing.

583
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,958
Days and nights have passed

584
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:59,792
Lives must go on

585
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:04,917
Time might have changed hearts

586
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:10,542
It keeps us apart

587
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,750
I never blame anyone

588
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:19,542
It's just the nature of time

589
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:28,167
Our old days can't be returned

590
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:34,583
But I want you to know

591
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:39,125
That I still care

592
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:42,375
I still think of you

593
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:46,292
Like I always have

594
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:49,000
Even though you left me

595
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:53,333
I'm still watching over you

596
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:57,167
And I want to know how you are

597
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,792
Because I've always loved you

598
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,875
Next. Mr. Maen.

599
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,500
How old are you?

600
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,042
Twenty-one years old.

601
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,750
You look as old as I am.

602
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:22,083
-Very well.
-Oh, lucky time, lucky time!

603
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,125
Survive, survive, survive!

604
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,875
Red. Red. Red!

605
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:35,000
Red. Red. Red!

606
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,250
Red!

607
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,500
Next. Mr. Payak.

608
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:54,458
Hey, it's the military draft.

609
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,083
Wives stay out of this.

610
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:58,500
-Get down there.
-It's Payak.

611
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:00,375
You are a man?

612
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,000
Yes, sir.

613
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,542
Very well.

614
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,292
Red.

615
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,042
Red. Red. Red!

616
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:10,542
Red. Red. Red!

617
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,542
Black!

618
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,167
Dammit.

619
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,625
Good hand, honey.

620
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:19,917
Don't be the country's soldier.

621
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,708
You only need to be my soldier. Let's go.

622
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:26,042
Next.

623
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,417
Mr. Mak.

624
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,625
Red. Red. Red!

625
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,375
Black! Black!

626
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,292
Red. Red. Red!

627
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,333
Red!

628
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:39,750
Dammit.

629
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:40,833
Duang.

630
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,375
It's late at night. You startled me.

631
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,000
Listen, Tid Noi.

632
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:55,125
Seeing you like this worries me.

633
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,333
Mark my words,

634
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,333
secretly, love will...

635
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,417
always hurt.

636
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,833
But if you truly love them,

637
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,250
when you see that they are happy,

638
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:24,167
you should be happy for them.

639
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,875
Accept them for who they are.

640
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,958
Now, that's love.

641
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,167
But one day,

642
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,083
if they see our good deeds,

643
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
they might turn around and look at us.

644
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,542
They are always together.

645
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,167
When will she see me?

646
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,583
Mak will join the military soon.

647
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,083
Mak? Join the military?

648
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:12,250
Yes.

649
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,042
Can you see it?

650
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,500
Yes, you are naughty.

651
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:26,333
Mak will join the military.

652
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:33,542
Duang, listen to me.

653
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,125
My whole life,

654
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,500
I've only loved Nak.

655
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:49,083
What's wrong with you?

656
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,208
What are you looking at?

657
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,083
The stars.

658
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,458
They look like Nak's face.

659
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,375
Wow.

660
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,250
The stars are beautiful.

661
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:18,583
What is that one called?

662
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,375
It's called a poking star.

663
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,125
-Mak.
-Don't worry.

664
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,375
Listen to me. Listen to me.

665
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:38,917
I promise that I'll come back to you.

666
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,708
Don't cry.

667
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,833
Nak, listen to me.

668
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,458
-Mak.
-I will be okay. I promise.

669
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:45,750
What did you do to her?

670
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,792
Mak, what did you do to her?

671
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,917
Mak, you are dead!

672
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,333
You are dead!

673
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,958
Don't worry, Nak.

674
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,375
I promise that I'll be back.

675
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:12,167
Mak, where are you going?

676
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,500
Tid Noi, please take care of Nak.

677
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,708
I must go to war.

678
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,167
I'll take care of her.

679
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,208
Don't worry. Don't worry.

680
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,917
Don't cry, please.

681
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,333
I'll come back.

682
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,458
I have to go now. I have to leave.

683
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:38,625
Mak.

684
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,333
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I'll come back, alright?

685
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:44,417
Tid Noi, take care of her.

686
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:46,583
Alright, don't worry.

687
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,333
Nak, don't worry about me.

688
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,250
I'll come back.

689
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,708
Why are you smiling?

690
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,917
I'm proud of him.

691
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,167
He sacrifices himself,

692
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,917
leaving his wife to serve his country.

693
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,083
He is a real man.

694
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:24,917
Nak!

695
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,250
Please take care of our baby.

696
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:29,042
No matter how much time has passed

697
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:36,083
I'm satisfied with everything as it is

698
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:40,333
Don't want to see you tired

699
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:43,958
Don't want to see you suffer

700
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:47,583
I will always support you from afar

701
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:52,375
Hoping that you have someone beautiful

702
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,792
Tid Noi, are you tired?

703
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,042
No, burns.

704
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:21,458
Want to drink it now?

705
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:24,458
-No.
-Oh.

706
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:27,292
Then, why did you ask me to pick them?

707
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,542
I have morning sickness.

708
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,750
I just want to see it.

709
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,125
Oh dear.

710
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:02,333
Nak. Here. They're huge.

711
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,708
What's the matter?

712
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:13,708
Tid Noi, I miss Mak.

713
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:16,833
I wasn't gone that long.

714
00:52:28,292 --> 00:52:29,625
I'm joking.

715
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,042
I just want to see you smile, Nak.

716
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,583
I'll make fish curry.

717
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:39,958
You've had enough chicken.

718
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:23,833
Don't you want to eat, Nak?

719
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,417
Here.

720
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,542
With this letter,

721
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,667
I hope you can eat something now.

722
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,625
A villager brought it for you.

723
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,417
It's from Mak.

724
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:53,792
Nak.

725
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:55,542
Nak, it's me, Mak.

726
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,917
This war is tough.

727
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:01,083
I was sent to the front line

728
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:05,292
and might not make it back
to you and our baby.

729
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,042
Please forget about me.

730
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:09,708
Don't wait for me.

731
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,667
Be well.

732
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,708
Tell Tid Noi to take care
of you and our baby.

733
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,208
Goodbye.

734
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,292
What did he say?

735
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:30,917
Hey, hey, hey.

736
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:32,958
Nak!

737
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:34,958
Nak!

738
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,500
Luckily, she didn't have a miscarriage

739
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:49,250
or she would have been dead.

740
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,833
Damn the moron who gave her the letter.

741
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,833
How thoughtless.
She is pregnant, goddammit!

742
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:29,708
Nak misses her husband.

743
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,625
She hasn't eaten in days.

744
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,000
Being like this,
she might have a miscarriage.

745
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,083
Poor thing.

746
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:46,792
-Mak.
-Nak.

747
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,042
Mak.

748
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,875
Nak.

749
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:56,542
If Mak were here, you wouldn't be sad.

750
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:03,208
I'll bring Mak back to you.

751
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:05,917
-Old Pun.
-Hmm?

752
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,917
-Please take care of Nak.
-Yes.

753
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:10,333
Oh.

754
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,667
And remember, it's important.

755
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,125
If she doesn't want something,

756
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,292
never force it on her.

757
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:17,875
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,833
She likes eel soup.

759
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:21,833
-Eel soup, yeah.
-And…

760
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,167
-She has breakfast at 5:30.
-Yeah, right.

761
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:28,792
-And not overly wet rice.
-Dammit, Noi.

762
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:31,417
Just leave me some time
to gamble, alright?

763
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,708
Dammit. Don't go, then.
Just stay here to take care of her.

764
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,208
Dammit, Noi.

765
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,000
In two months, Nak,
I'll bring Mak back to you.

766
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,167
Why is it not coming out?

767
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,917
Wait a minute. Wait.

768
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,833
Nak,

769
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:31,000
you are beautiful up there and down here.

770
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:33,833
Come on. Try again. Push! Push!

771
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:00,125
One more time.

772
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,458
Push!

773
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:04,583
Why is it so stubborn?

774
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:07,792
Push.

775
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,000
Tid Noi!

776
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,375
Pee Mak!

777
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,083
Mak!

778
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,833
Nak. Nak.

779
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:15,292
Mak, get up.

780
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:23,083
Mak.

781
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:41,083
Mak.

782
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,125
Mak, are you hurt?

783
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:44,958
Tid Noi.

784
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,417
Am I going to die?

785
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:48,292
You can't die.

786
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,708
I promised Nak

787
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,542
that I would bring you back to her.

788
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,958
They… They are approaching.

789
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:03,500
Tid Noi, listen to me.

790
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:07,125
Go back to take care of Nak for me.

791
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,708
If we both die,
she wouldn't know what happened.

792
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,333
No. I promised her
that I would bring you back, Mak.

793
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:15,750
I beg you.

794
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:17,208
-Mak, you must come with me.
-I beg you.

795
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,958
Go. Go.

796
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,000
Go.

797
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,750
-Mak.
-Go.

798
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:14,625
It's frightening enough
to die from a violent death,

799
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:17,208
but she died while giving birth.

800
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:22,542
In no time,
she'll really give us a hard time.

801
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,833
In two months, Nak,

802
01:02:40,292 --> 01:02:42,708
I will bring Mak back to you.

803
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,250
Nak.

804
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,375
Mak.

805
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,750
No matter what, I will take you back.

806
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,792
Tid Noi.

807
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,417
Mak, keep your mouth shut. Be still.

808
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:06,208
Tid Noi.

809
01:03:06,292 --> 01:03:07,375
I know.

810
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:08,958
I'm here.

811
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,375
Who the hell is this? Damn.

812
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:25,833
Let's go.

813
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,500
Get up.

814
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:37,875
FIFTEEN DAYS LATER

815
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:39,500
Take a break, Mak.

816
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,375
Tid Noi.

817
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,417
Thank you for taking care of me.

818
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,625
Yeah.

819
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:54,583
Are you applying more medicine?

820
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,792
-No.
-What?

821
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,583
I'm chewing a Kratom leaf.

822
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,625
Isn't it for sun resistance?

823
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,500
Two leaves for sun protection,

824
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:05,708
one leaf for nighttime resistance.

825
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:09,583
Let's go.

826
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:17,458
How many fish did you catch?

827
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:19,250
I got a lot of perch.

828
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,792
I'll stir-fry it with curry sauce for you.

829
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:26,917
What was that?

830
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,417
There are no men in the jungle.

831
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,500
What are you looking for?

832
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,625
I'm not looking for men, dammit.

833
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,708
I heard a baby cry.

834
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,375
A baby in the jungle? Why are you scared?

835
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:56,875
-Why the hell did you scream? Run, wench.
-Go on. Go.

836
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:59,083
Duang. Duang. Duang, wait for me.

837
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:09,917
Keep on walking.

838
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,417
My beautiful bird

839
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:20,250
Why don't you become mine?

840
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:23,875
My beautiful bird

841
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:28,875
If you don't love me, I'll curse you

842
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:34,667
To have dry poop in your butthole

843
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,250
Hey.

844
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:40,917
Wait, wait, wait.

845
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,333
There are women ahead.

846
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,583
Let's see how drunk we are.

847
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,125
Look at them.

848
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:53,375
If the two women become four,
that means you are drunk.

849
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,583
-I can only see one woman.
-What?

850
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,292
Damn, I'm drunk.

851
01:05:59,375 --> 01:06:01,083
You are drunk, Ang.

852
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:02,958
-Who's Ang? I'm Eung.
-Oh.

853
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,875
Just stand still.

854
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:06,333
Let me take a look.

855
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,917
Hold this.

856
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,417
Here.

857
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,333
Once I get to her, I'll lift her up.

858
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,375
You fatty.

859
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,875
Whoa.

860
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,583
Oh.

861
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,375
Her natural smell is nice.

862
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,958
Come here. Talk to me.

863
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:28,958
Let's have a chat. Come on.

864
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:30,417
He's abducting her.

865
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,417
Hey, Ang.

866
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:36,958
Hand!

867
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:39,625
What hand? You're talking nonsense.

868
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,917
-Ang.
-What is wrong with him?

869
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,375
Fine. You can go.

870
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,458
I'll keep her for myself.

871
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,667
Let's talk.

872
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:57,167
Whoa! How come a ghost is so beautiful?

873
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:07,333
My dear Mak

874
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,583
My dear Mak

875
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,625
Nuan. Nuan.

876
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,042
Open the door for me.

877
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:23,542
Pee Mak

878
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,542
Oh, there.

879
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:27,417
Nak.

880
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:29,833
Pee Mak.

881
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:33,333
-Nak.
-Pee Mak.

882
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:35,417
Nak.

883
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:37,583
Pee Mak.

884
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:41,333
I'm not mentioned once.

885
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:44,083
Nak.

886
01:07:44,667 --> 01:07:46,625
-Tid Noi, paddle closer.
-Yeah.

887
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,000
-Do you know how to paddle?
-Hurry up.

888
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:49,458
I'm back.

889
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:53,250
I missed you so much.

890
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,833
-Mak.
-Nak.

891
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:57,792
-Be careful.
-I'm back.

892
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,917
I missed you so much, Nak.

893
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,792
I missed you too.

894
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:15,542
I missed you every day.

895
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:28,083
How about our baby?

896
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,542
The baby is sleeping in the house.

897
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:31,875
I see.

898
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,583
Is it a girl or a boy?

899
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,292
-A boy.
-What's his nickname?

900
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:39,250
I'm waiting for you to name him.

901
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,458
You are Nak, I'm Mak.

902
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,667
Let's call him… Daeng.

903
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,375
-Daeng?
-Daeng.

904
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:48,792
That's nice.

905
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:51,833
How about his name?

906
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:53,208
His name…

907
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,042
Mak. Mak. Mak. Mak.

908
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:58,917
His name… Somkid.

909
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,750
-Somkid.
-Somkid.

910
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,250
That's nice.

911
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,792
Somkid.

912
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,750
Somkid, my son, dad is back.

913
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,042
Get inside.

914
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,417
Dad's name is Mak.

915
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:13,583
Mom's name is Nak.

916
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,083
His nickname is Daeng.

917
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:19,708
His name is Somkid.

918
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,917
How the hell is it all related?

919
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,500
I missed you so much.

920
01:09:34,958 --> 01:09:36,292
No.

921
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:39,375
-No.
-Damn!

922
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,750
Mak.

923
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:43,083
You are breaking the promise you gave me.

924
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,417
I told you.

925
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,625
If she doesn't want something,
never force it on her.

926
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,917
Tid Noi, you know nothing.

927
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,333
What do I not know?

928
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:52,875
I told you.

929
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:56,125
If she doesn't want something,
never force her.

930
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:58,542
It's kind of late.

931
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:00,625
Go to bed.

932
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,250
Mak.

933
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:18,750
Mak!

934
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:20,417
Stop!

935
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,083
Daeng will wake up?

936
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,500
Tid Noi will hear us.

937
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,792
Damn!

938
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,542
What are you talking about, Duang?

939
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,958
I just spoke to Nak last night.

940
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,917
You spoke to a ghost!

941
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:57,500
Didn't you notice, Tid Noi?
The villagers around here moved away.

942
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,250
Nonsense. Keep on shaving.

943
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,417
You are annoying.

944
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,083
Fine.

945
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,292
What's wrong with you?

946
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,458
Where are you going?

947
01:11:31,542 --> 01:11:34,500
I'll go buy an axe to fix the stairs.

948
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:37,125
Ouch, Nak. My wound.

949
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,333
I was shot.

950
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,500
You can ask Tid Noi to buy it for you.

951
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:41,792
It's alright.

952
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:43,958
I owe him my life.

953
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:45,542
It's nothing. I can do it myself.

954
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:47,417
I won't be long.

955
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:51,000
Come on. I'll be back soon.

956
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:04,167
Can I have an axe?

957
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:35,667
Mak.

958
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,833
What is it, old man?

959
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:41,958
This axe can't kill a ghost.

960
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:51,958
Why did you say that?

961
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:56,292
Mak, I'll tell you the truth.

962
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,125
You are living with a ghost.

963
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:10,625
Why do you say my wife is a ghost?

964
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:12,167
Your wife,

965
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,333
she looks like a ghost,
but I never say a word.

966
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:15,917
I'm telling the truth.

967
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,208
I'm also telling the truth.

968
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,333
Look. She looks like a ghost.

969
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:21,542
Your wife…

970
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,458
Your wife is dead!

971
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,208
Hey, Leua, Lae.

972
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,125
-Oh.
-Hi, Tid Noi.

973
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:38,875
Will you come to drink at my house?

974
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,083
That sounds good. I feel like drinking.

975
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:42,208
I'd rather not.

976
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,958
I'm afraid of Nak's ghost.

977
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:48,083
Why are you afraid of her?

978
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,917
Stop talking to him.

979
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,583
Let's go. Come on.

980
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,417
These guys are so strange.

981
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,000
They say the same thing as Duang.

982
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,583
Jeez, Nak. She haunts even during the day.

983
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:16,083
-Lua, Hurry up!
-Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

984
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:17,917
Paddle. Come on.

985
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:20,833
Quick!

986
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:22,083
Hurry up. Keep paddling.

987
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,917
-Hey. What's going on?
-Hurry!

988
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,750
You don't believe that Nak is a ghost.
See for yourself.

989
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:27,625
Paddle!

990
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,292
What the hell?

991
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:31,167
Go and take a look over there. Hurry.

992
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,333
Swim to the shore.

993
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:36,583
Let's go.

994
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:50,750
Nak!

995
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,625
Nak!

996
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:02,083
Nak!

997
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:05,750
Nak!

998
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,667
Nak!

999
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:13,958
Damn!

1000
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:19,000
-Tid Noi!
-Nak.

1001
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:22,708
You…

1002
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,375
You hold your breath for so long.

1003
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:32,542
Now I see why the villagers say that.

1004
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:34,417
What do they say?

1005
01:15:34,792 --> 01:15:36,583
They say you are a ghost.

1006
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:38,875
It's too long, that's why.

1007
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:54,708
How did she dry off so quickly?

1008
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,625
Hey, Nak.

1009
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,750
You can go prepare a meal for Mak.

1010
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:02,875
Let me put Daeng to sleep.

1011
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,667
And make some for me.

1012
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,500
You want to eat my food?

1013
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,000
I want to eat with you.

1014
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:21,208
Come on, Daeng.

1015
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,167
Try to get some sleep now.

1016
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:31,958
The grand

1017
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:36,042
Strategy

1018
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:42,500
With great determination

1019
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,125
Hey, Tid Noi.

1020
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:47,542
Are you singing a lullaby or a war song?

1021
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,917
Mak, why do you look like that?

1022
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,375
-You look frustrated.
-What's wrong with the villagers?

1023
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,083
They say Nak is a ghost.

1024
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,375
-Yeah, I heard it, too.
-Right?

1025
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:02,583
From now on,
if anyone says Nak is a ghost,

1026
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:05,792
I'll chop off their heads with an axe.

1027
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,208
Before that,
let me kick their asses first.

1028
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,292
Yeah.

1029
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:11,958
Go on. I'll put him to sleep.

1030
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:21,000
Luang Por.

1031
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,875
Let's go back.

1032
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,083
Why are you scared?
You are coming with a monk.

1033
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:32,542
Besides, today,
I have to tell Mak the truth.

1034
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:41,125
Jingle bells…

1035
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,500
Mak.

1036
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:45,750
Mak, you are no different than me.

1037
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:49,042
Who is at the dock?

1038
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:55,250
Luang Por is here, Mak.

1039
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,125
What are you scared of, Meng?

1040
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,250
What's wrong?

1041
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:01,000
Is Mak here?

1042
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:03,208
Tid Noi is here.

1043
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:04,792
Mak is here too.

1044
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,542
-Greetings, Luang Por.
-Bless you.

1045
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,208
-Greetings, Luang Por.
-Oh…

1046
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:17,292
I think you should put the axe down, Mak.

1047
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,167
Hey, there you go again.

1048
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,208
Don't tell me that you are here about Nak.

1049
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,375
Who'd want to do that?

1050
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,833
But Mak, you have to be mindful

1051
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,667
and think of the Buddha's teaching.

1052
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:37,042
Bow down and look through your legs.

1053
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:41,125
You will see what reality is.

1054
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,083
What is the reality, Luang Por?

1055
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:56,583
The reality is always true.

1056
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,708
Meng, let's go. Whoa! He is too fast.

1057
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:02,208
Wait for me.

1058
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:04,000
Meng!

1059
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:06,792
Hey.

1060
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,042
-Go.
-Hurry.

1061
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,583
He didn't even untie the rope.

1062
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,000
Look through my legs?

1063
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:20,792
Yet he has the audacity
to tell us to be mindful,

1064
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:22,000
but he isn't.

1065
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,500
He also talks nonsense.

1066
01:20:01,042 --> 01:20:03,750
Mak, you have to be mindful

1067
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:05,542
and think of the Buddha's teaching.

1068
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,458
Bow down and look through your legs.

1069
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:12,083
You will see what reality is.

1070
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:32,833
Damn.

1071
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,667
Hey, Mak.

1072
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,958
Damn, snake.

1073
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,625
Hey, Mak.

1074
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:55,750
Nak?

1075
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Oh, damn.

1076
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,208
Nak.

1077
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:08,875
Damn!

1078
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,125
Duang. Duang.

1079
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,667
Duang, Nak is…

1080
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,000
I know.

1081
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,042
-Go to the temple now.
-I have to go.

1082
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,250
Hey, wait. Where is Tid Noi?

1083
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,625
He's still at home.

1084
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:22,958
I have to go.

1085
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:31,125
Tid Noi. That moron knows nothing.

1086
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,333
Nak, did you see a snake?

1087
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:40,250
Tid Noi.

1088
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,167
Mak is gone.

1089
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,333
He is only scared of a snake.

1090
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:49,208
Where is she?

1091
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:50,750
Is she here?

1092
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:52,167
Uncle…

1093
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,542
-Is it her?
-It's here.

1094
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,292
Is that you, Nak?

1095
01:21:58,375 --> 01:21:59,875
Call her out, Uncle.

1096
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:01,458
Nak.

1097
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,292
Nak.

1098
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,250
-There she is.
-Nak is here.

1099
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:23,083
Nak, do you know
that you cause trouble for the villagers?

1100
01:22:23,542 --> 01:22:25,708
I live with my husband
and mind my own business,

1101
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:27,750
but you are asking for trouble.

1102
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:31,000
You will die again tonight.

1103
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:32,667
-Is that right, folks?
-Yes.

1104
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:36,333
Nak, do you know that since your death,

1105
01:22:36,417 --> 01:22:38,333
we never get to sleep?

1106
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,625
The dogs howl every night.

1107
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:42,958
It's about time I slap a ghost.

1108
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:46,000
-Go.
-Take her. Take her. Take her.

1109
01:22:47,292 --> 01:22:49,000
You want to try me?

1110
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:50,583
Fine!

1111
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:09,250
What a harsh wind.

1112
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:14,708
Nak, let's go inside.

1113
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:16,208
It's going to rain.

1114
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:17,833
What should we do?

1115
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:19,375
She is getting serious.

1116
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,750
Nak, you said you'd destroy us.

1117
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,833
If you won't, we'll burn your house down.

1118
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:30,250
Burn it. Burn it.

1119
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:34,042
If you burn my house,
I'll burn your village.

1120
01:23:39,458 --> 01:23:41,375
There she goes again.

1121
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,250
Nak, I think…

1122
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,750
Scare them with the dive trick!

1123
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,417
Dive for fucking what?

1124
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:55,500
Nak.

1125
01:23:56,417 --> 01:23:58,750
You said "fuck" to my face.

1126
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:03,708
You said "fuck" to my face.

1127
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:09,750
-Uncle, go ahead.
-Burn it.

1128
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,000
My dear Mak.

1129
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:52,875
Let's go back home.

1130
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,000
Come on, everyone.

1131
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:08,292
Stay focused.

1132
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,333
Let's… Let's keep on chanting.

1133
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,250
Mak.

1134
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,542
Come back to your wife and baby.

1135
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:22,583
-Mak.
-Listen!

1136
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:25,083
Ghosts should not live with humans.

1137
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:26,708
Monks should mind their own business.

1138
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,000
Mak.

1139
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:34,458
Come back to your wife and baby.

1140
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,083
She said "fuck" to my face.

1141
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:46,542
-Where are you off to, Tid Noi?
-Oh, hey.

1142
01:25:46,625 --> 01:25:49,292
I'll take my sweetheart to the market.

1143
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:04,625
Dive for fucking what?

1144
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,833
You said "fuck" to me.

1145
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:12,000
Nak.

1146
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:17,500
Are you hurt?

1147
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,333
Not at all.

1148
01:26:26,542 --> 01:26:27,875
Dive for fucking…

1149
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:31,167
You said "fuck" to me, Nak.

1150
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:51,875
Dive…

1151
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,542
Nak.

1152
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:58,000
You said "fuck" to me.

1153
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:01,958
Nak.

1154
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:06,083
-Tid Noi.
-Duang.

1155
01:27:06,542 --> 01:27:10,125
When you visit someone's home,
have some courtesy.

1156
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:16,875
-Should I knock?
-Yeah.

1157
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,125
Who's there?

1158
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,625
Damn! He's still asking.

1159
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,458
It's me, Duang.

1160
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:38,417
Come in.

1161
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:00,792
Tid Noi.

1162
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,875
Don't be upset.

1163
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,958
She's dead.

1164
01:28:07,917 --> 01:28:09,458
What the hell is wrong with you?

1165
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:19,083
Even Mak knows that his wife is dead.

1166
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,000
Mak,

1167
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,375
you eventually believe other people
rather than your wife.

1168
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,083
Where is he?

1169
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:34,125
-At the temple.
-And Nak?

1170
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:38,958
She must have followed him there.

1171
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:47,958
No.

1172
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:49,917
I'm not going.

1173
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,917
I'm definitely not going.

1174
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:55,625
Novice!

1175
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:57,917
Go get the supreme monk.

1176
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,292
Yes.

1177
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,625
Mak. You!

1178
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:10,292
I don't know what you ran away from,

1179
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,083
but I want to know what this is all about.

1180
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:15,542
You believe other people
rather than your wife, don't you?

1181
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:22,125
If Nak finds out about this,
how upset will she be?

1182
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:25,708
And the person who is
a thousand times more upset

1183
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:27,667
is me.

1184
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,333
Because I love her.

1185
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:33,333
I don't want to see
someone I love unhappy.

1186
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:41,375
My love is not about possessions.

1187
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:44,708
It would make me happy
just to take care of her.

1188
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,917
That's what my love is.

1189
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,125
I'm different from you, Mak.

1190
01:29:49,792 --> 01:29:53,708
Your love is small.

1191
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:55,208
You are small-minded,

1192
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,250
but I'm open-minded.

1193
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:01,750
You have true love,

1194
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:05,750
but I have true-true-true-true love

1195
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:06,833
True times four.

1196
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:25,917
Even the rain witnesses my love.

1197
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,000
Nak.

1198
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:40,875
Just your smile makes me so happy.

1199
01:30:47,167 --> 01:30:48,250
Nak!

1200
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:58,667
Can he really not see us?

1201
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,333
Morning sickness.
Just want to see the coconut.

1202
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:07,333
Just want to see?

1203
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,083
I just want to see it.

1204
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:17,750
Where is Nak anyway?

1205
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,750
Nak.

1206
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,875
Nak. Nak.

1207
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:29,542
Tid Noi.

1208
01:31:30,167 --> 01:31:31,958
You said you are open-minded.

1209
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:33,875
Yeah. Why?

1210
01:31:33,958 --> 01:31:35,375
Why don't you look up?

1211
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:40,542
No. There's nothing there.

1212
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:57,125
Mak.

1213
01:31:58,792 --> 01:31:59,833
Mak.

1214
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:06,708
Nak.

1215
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,000
Nak.

1216
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:20,875
If there is a next life,

1217
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:25,000
I hope we can be husband and wife again.

1218
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:28,458
Mak.

1219
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,417
Take care of yourself.

1220
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:38,292
The baby and I have to go.

1221
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:42,917
Thank Tid Noi for me.

1222
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:46,625
Nak.

1223
01:32:47,167 --> 01:32:48,458
Mak.

1224
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:51,708
Nak.

1225
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:53,083
Mak.

1226
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:56,833
Nak.

1227
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
-Nak.
-Mak.

1228
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:13,417
Nak.

1229
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:23,042
-Nak.
-Mak.

1230
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,500
Nak.

1231
01:33:29,875 --> 01:33:30,958
Nak.

1232
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:31,958
Oh?

1233
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:35,208
Nak?

1234
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:37,292
Nak?

1235
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:50,333
Nak!

1236
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:02,583
Nak!

1237
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,625
What kind of storm was this?

1238
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,750
The house appears to be old overnight.

1239
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,000
This way, please.

1240
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:54,917
Mak.

1241
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:57,125
I mean, Luang Pee Mak.

1242
01:35:58,458 --> 01:35:59,583
Well…

1243
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:04,208
Is it what I said last night
that inspired you to become a monk?

1244
01:36:12,042 --> 01:36:18,792
-Ayu vanno sukham balam.
-And… Where is Nak?

1245
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,750
She's gone.

1246
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,917
Where to?

1247
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,083
To the north?

1248
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:44,667
The south?

1249
01:36:46,833 --> 01:36:48,167
Take a shit.

1250
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:50,125
Is Nak a southerner?

1251
01:36:50,792 --> 01:36:52,250
She's gone back to the south.

1252
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:02,667
Won't you tell him the truth?

1253
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:07,917
He won't believe me anyway.

1254
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,875
Sometimes, ignorance

1255
01:37:12,208 --> 01:37:14,375
makes you happier.

1256
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:18,708
When will she be back?

1257
01:37:57,708 --> 01:38:00,667
My dear Nak.

1258
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:23,583
TEN YEARS LATER

1259
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,542
Whoa, Noi.

1260
01:38:35,292 --> 01:38:37,000
Have you taken care of yourself?

1261
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:40,750
Don't you want to shave it?

1262
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:51,042
-Ayu vanno sukham balam.
-Well…

1263
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,167
Nak?

1264
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:55,250
She hasn't come back yet, Tid Noi.

1265
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:10,333
My dear Nak.

1266
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:14,500
Why does he love Nak so much?

1267
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:17,458
Tid Noi's love

1268
01:39:18,417 --> 01:39:20,083
is not true love

1269
01:39:21,375 --> 01:39:25,375
but true-true love.

1270
01:39:29,708 --> 01:39:31,083
Tid Noi.

1271
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:45,625
Are you still waiting for Nak?

1272
01:39:46,292 --> 01:39:48,500
Yes, I am.

1273
01:39:53,292 --> 01:39:56,000
If you wait, I'll wait.

1274
01:39:59,542 --> 01:40:00,750
For Nak?

1275
01:40:00,833 --> 01:40:02,208
For you.

1276
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:17,958
Tid Noi.

1277
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:26,167
TID NOI

1278
01:40:31,583 --> 01:40:34,333
Oh, I think I'm really scared.

1279
01:40:34,417 --> 01:40:36,875
Oh, I'm scared.

1280
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:38,583
It's really high up here.

1281
01:40:38,667 --> 01:40:40,167
My legs are shaking.

1282
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:43,167
Let me close my eyes.

1283
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:45,333
My hands are shaking.

1284
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,667
Why is it shaking?

1285
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,542
I can't open my eyes. I'm scared.

1286
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:53,250
Just sit down on the beam.

1287
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,875
Wait, wait, wait.

1288
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,542
Just wait.

1289
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:01,458
Okay? Okay now?

1290
01:41:01,542 --> 01:41:03,458
Just a moment.

1291
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:05,833
Nothing to hold onto. I'm scared.

1292
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:10,167
I feel light-headed.

1293
01:41:10,583 --> 01:41:11,667
Tid Noi.

1294
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,125
I miss Mak.

1295
01:41:14,667 --> 01:41:16,333
-Can I go again?
-Yes.

1296
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:19,958
Hello.

1297
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:21,667
Hello. My name is Na…

1298
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:23,000
Again.

1299
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:24,958
I said Nak…

1300
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:28,792
And the person who is
a thousand times more upset

1301
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:30,417
is me.

1302
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:34,292
Because I love her.

1303
01:41:34,375 --> 01:41:35,583
Again. Again. Again.

1304
01:41:37,667 --> 01:41:41,000
My dear Mak

1305
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:44,708
-Okay.
-My voice dropped.

1306
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:47,500
Oh, wait.

1307
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:49,542
Easy, easy.

1308
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:51,292
Meng, where are you going?

1309
01:41:51,917 --> 01:41:54,000
-Hand…
-Here you go again.

1310
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:55,708
Hand me the paddle.

1311
01:42:04,583 --> 01:42:07,083
Haven't you noticed, Tid Noi,

1312
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:10,458
that the villagers around here…
Damn, I was babbling.

1313
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:20,083
The mango went the wrong way.

1314
01:42:24,542 --> 01:42:25,875
Slate.

1315
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:28,292
I'm choking on the mango.

1316
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:29,750
Give me some water.

1317
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:31,292
Nak.

1318
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:32,792
Nak must be busy.

1319
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:35,167
because she will send me off.

1320
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:39,167
Why don't you know anything?

1321
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:42,042
I want to sing too.

1322
01:42:43,667 --> 01:42:44,750
Lie down.

1323
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,583
Dammit.

1324
01:42:51,167 --> 01:42:52,708
I'm so scared of you.

1325
01:42:54,625 --> 01:42:55,792
Gotta tuck the flower in.

1326
01:42:59,417 --> 01:43:00,833
Slate.

1327
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:04,292
Cut eight, take one. Camera after slate.

1328
01:43:04,792 --> 01:43:06,542
Wait. What is that?

1329
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:08,167
-It's been cut.
-Cut, my butt.

1330
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,708
I haven't said a damn word, Meng.

1331
01:43:10,792 --> 01:43:13,000
I came here at dawn just for this?

1332
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:14,792
I am not blaming you,
I blame the director.

1333
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:15,958
Who?

1334
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:17,292
Who is the director?

1335
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:19,292
-Teng.
-Did you say Teng?

1336
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:20,583
Yeah.

1337
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:21,750
Teng.

1338
01:43:22,667 --> 01:43:24,083
What is this?

1339
01:43:24,167 --> 01:43:25,958
A movie, Tid Noi.

1340
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:29,542
I'm asking about my character.
Why am I needed here?

1341
01:43:29,625 --> 01:43:31,500
Do you dare to do this to Ananda?

1342
01:43:31,583 --> 01:43:32,917
Do what?

1343
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,542
Do what? Just in one scene
and shot to death.

1344
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:37,833
I spend more time dressing up
than featuring.

1345
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:39,292
Just wait for Tid Noi 2.

1346
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:42,000
You think there'll be a Tid Noi 2?

1347
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:43,625
Trilogy, even.

1348
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:45,167
Trilogy, my butt, Teng.

1349
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,958
What are you laughing at, Tor?

1350
01:43:48,583 --> 01:43:50,417
-What are you laughing at?
-I'll take you on the boat.

1351
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,333
No. I can swim, prick.

1352
01:43:52,417 --> 01:43:53,708
What are you looking at?

1353
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:56,958
Cut.

1354
01:43:57,042 --> 01:43:58,125
