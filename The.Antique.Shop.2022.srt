00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
សូមស្វាគមន៍មកកាន់ MonoPlays.com

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
សូមរីករាយទស្សនាដោយសេរី

3
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>Yeah, I know, I know.</i>

4
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,083
<i>After visiting the antique shop,</i>

5
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,125
I will go straight to the airport.
It won't take long, okay? See you.

6
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,833
Why don't you try looking at
those old plates or bowls?

7
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,000
Singaporeans like to look at them.

8
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,166
How do you know that I'm a Singaporean?

9
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:49,125
I have met a lot of people
to know where they are from.

10
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,333
If you're interested in any pieces,

11
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,125
just let me know.

12
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,041
They are all antique.

13
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,041
And all have their own story behind them.

14
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:13,750
Pick one.

15
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,083
I will tell you a story.

16
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,416
Alex, come and help me here.

17
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,916
Numerous people have died on this chair,

18
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,666
but only one,

19
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,041
different from the others.

20
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,166
He is an Indonesian.

21
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,250
<i>Entered to work in Thailand as a driver.</i>

22
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,541
Like everyone,

23
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,541
he wanted to get an honest job.

24
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,166
But he never thought that…

25
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,708
it would bring him
to the dark side of Bangkok.

26
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
<i>To survive a near-death situation,</i>

27
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,500
<i>first thing</i>

28
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,125
<i>is to leave the fear behind.</i>

29
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,291
I did ask him.

30
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,666
Damn, what do these Indonesians eat
to make them so tough?

31
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,541
I can't get a single word out of him.

32
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,166
Of course.

33
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,375
I've been beating him
and kicking his guts out.

34
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,083
Yes.

35
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,416
I checked. He's Boss Chai's driver.

36
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,791
Krit!

37
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,250
He's coming around.

38
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,250
Okay, I'll try again.

39
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:27,791
Yeah.

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,208
Waking up?

41
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,416
Don't just stand there. Lift him up.
This guy is as huge as a buffalo.

42
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,125
Come on.

43
00:04:58,833 --> 00:04:59,916
Now.

44
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,875
It's time to tell me,

45
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:06,083
where is my stuff?

46
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,125
Can I have more time?

47
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,750
I have to take this job
to make some money for us.

48
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,125
I will come back for you.

49
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,625
I promise.

50
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,125
And you just let him?
Where's the stuff I asked you to get?

51
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,750
Did you listen to us?

52
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,875
Did you listen to us talking?

53
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
I don't understand Thai, sir.

54
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,166
I have a job for you.

55
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,625
It needs someone new.

56
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,208
Go to this location

57
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,541
and pick up a package.

58
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,708
And this is money for your job.

59
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,833
Boss,

60
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,916
I told you before.

61
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't do this kind of work.

62
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,291
Right now, you are the one
I trust the most.

63
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,708
Hey! What's that? Don't even try!

64
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,041
Walk!

65
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,750
Hey!

66
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,541
Krit! Why did you shoot him?

67
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,208
Don't yell at me, asshole.

68
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,833
But you're being loud!

69
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,041
You're fucking louder.

70
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,916
Hey, hey!

71
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,916
Get up!

72
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,625
Get up!

73
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,208
Move!

74
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,125
Move!

75
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,000
Now what?

76
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,000
Ask him, dumbass.

77
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,708
Where is it?

78
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,583
I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,333
He said he doesn't know.

80
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,500
Doesn't know, my ass!

81
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,416
Everyone knows it's you.

82
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,083
All right.

83
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,708
If you don't wanna die,

84
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,291
tell me,

85
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,000
where is my stuff?

86
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,875
You don't think I have the guts to do it?

87
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,083
Tell me or fucking die!

88
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:57,666
That's enough!
If he dies, how can we find it?

89
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,208
He's not going to die, damn it!
Have you ever beaten someone, asshole?

90
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,041
Fuck, it's him again!

91
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,666
Yes, boss.

92
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,875
I did ask him.

93
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,208
Damn, what do these Indonesians eat
to make them so tough?

94
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,041
I can't get a single word out of him.

95
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,208
Of course.

96
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,833
I've been beating him
and kicking his guts out.

97
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,333
Yes.

98
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,916
I checked. He's Boss Chai's driver.

99
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,041
When I find my drugs,

100
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,625
I'll blow your brains out.

101
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,000
Krit,

102
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,833
it's getting dark.

103
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,583
Let's take him somewhere else
to force him to talk.

104
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,833
Are you chickening out?

105
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,083
As if you'd never been here
at night before.

106
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,375
Krit.

107
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,833
People say…

108
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:52,333
that when someone dies,
their spirit will return after three days.

109
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,541
Aren't you scared?

110
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,875
If you want to leave,

111
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,833
make him talk first.

112
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:04,416
I've been slugging him for hours
while you just stand there and watch.

113
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,666
Hey! Where is my stuff?

114
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,250
Hey, listen! Look at me!

115
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,750
What the hell are you looking at?

116
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,125
Tell me or fucking die!

117
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,500
You almost hit me.

118
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,625
What?

119
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,958
Did you throw something at me?

120
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,291
No, I didn't!

121
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,500
You're so creeped out
that this shit gets into your brain.

122
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,375
Dude, you know I'm scared.

123
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,291
-It's not funny.
-All right. Take it easy.

124
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,458
The boss just texted me.
He'll talk to Boss Chai first.

125
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,791
I really don't know.

126
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm just a small-time peddler.
I don't know how the cops found out.

127
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,541
I'm not a rat.

128
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,416
You can ask anyone.

129
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:44,750
I'm just an office man.
I just wanted to make some extra money!

130
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,208
-Who's that?
-The boss, of course.

131
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes, boss.

132
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,500
<i>Are you still with the Indonesian guy?</i>

133
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:46,958
Yes.

134
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,291
<i>I found the packages he stashed</i>

135
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,708
<i>in the restroom where you got him.</i>

136
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:53,500
Okay.

137
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,541
<i>Chai said he had quit the driver's job.</i>
<i>He knows nothing about the drug.</i>

138
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,875
What do you want me to do with him?

139
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,875
What did he say?

140
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,208
He found the drugs.

141
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,791
Then let's get out of here.

142
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,291
Not so fast. Let's kill him first.

143
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,500
<i>I will come back for you.</i>

144
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,541
<i>I promise.</i>

145
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:13,875
What's wrong?

146
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:16,833
It's jammed. Shit!

147
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,416
Doung, what are you waiting for?

148
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,708
Shoot him! Come on!

149
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,791
<i>Things you haven't done.</i>

150
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,333
<i>Never encountered a situation.</i>

151
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,833
<i>Something unexpected happened.</i>

152
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,500
<i>Those we normally fear.</i>

153
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,666
<i>If you are in control of yourself</i>
<i>and try to understand them,</i>

154
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,000
<i>the fear will fade away.</i>

155
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,625
<i>It is a way to control your fear.</i>

156
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,041
The only survivor is him.

157
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,083
From then on,

158
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,833
no one dares to kill anyone
at that place again.

159
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,333
Is it really true?

160
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,875
I never thought
there are such things in Thailand.

161
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,916
I heard it from someone else.

162
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,416
Objects.

163
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,166
The more stories they have,

164
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,250
the more valuable they are.

165
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,250
This bracelet.

166
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,958
Is there any story behind it?

167
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,000
Very observant.

168
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,291
Do you wanna know

169
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,875
who this bracelet

170
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,833
belongs to?

171
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,958
The person wearing the bracelet…

172
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,708
would always

173
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,625
hear a voice saying,

174
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:41,958
"Help me."

175
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,291
"Help me!"

176
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,375
The owner of the bracelet
is a Singaporean.

177
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:53,916
Just like yourself.

178
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,416
But one day…

179
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,500
he suddenly disappeared.

180
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,125
His girlfriend kept this bracelet.

181
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:13,041
And she would always
hear his voice ringing

182
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,041
every time she wears it.

183
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,500
Help me!

184
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,416
You hear something?

185
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,708
I heard that he is trapped
somewhere in Thailand.

186
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,375
Do you want to hear the story?

187
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,041
<i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>of "replacement death"?</i>

188
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,333
<i>I believe that's</i>
<i>what happened to my friend.</i>

189
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,000
<i>Did you and your friend</i>
<i>go back to that abandoned house?</i>

190
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:09,166
<i>Hell no!</i>
<i>A ghost followed my friend all night.</i>

191
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,916
<i>We'll never go back there.</i>

192
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:28,625
<i>Well, be warned, guys.</i>
<i>Don't take any unnecessary risks.</i>

193
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:33,375
<i>Just a reminder, ghosts are everywhere.</i>
<i>No need to go ghost-hunting.</i>

194
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,541
-Hello!
-Sarge, hurry up!

195
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,333
Hey.

196
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:02,916
Hey! Hello!

197
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:04,500
Hey!

198
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,958
Hey, get me out of here. Hello! Hey!

199
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,625
-Hurry up!
-Hey!

200
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,458
Hey, can you hear me?

201
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:13,125
Hey!

202
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:19,958
Help.

203
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:21,875
Help me!

204
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,291
GET ME OUT OF HERE

205
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,333
Hey! Can you hear me?
There's something in here.

206
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,250
Hey, help me out. There's something--

207
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,708
<i>He should be okay.</i>

208
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,000
I gave up everything I had for you.

209
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,625
And this is how you treat me.
You cheated on me.

210
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,000
When he wakes up,
make sure he pays for the damage.

211
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:58,000
Open the door!

212
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,125
Help!

213
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:28,000
What happened? How did it happen?

214
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:29,750
He had blood coming out of his ear.

215
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:33,333
So I went out to get help.
When I returned, he had stopped breathing.

216
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:49,625
Sarge, hurry up!

217
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:50,750
Yes, sir.

218
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,000
We only have eight minutes to save him.
Hurry up!

219
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,208
It's almost eight minutes!

220
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,541
<i>Listen to me.</i>

221
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,041
You are misunderstanding me.

222
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,500
Hey, Ryan.

223
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,083
<i>Ryan, I think you are misunderstanding me.</i>

224
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:52,500
<i>My ex just consulted me about his problem.</i>

225
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,375
<i>There is nothing between us.</i>

226
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:58,916
<i>Please say something to me.</i>
<i>Hey, Ryan. Ryan!</i>

227
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,458
Wrong number.

228
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:25,666
<i>Well, be warned, guys.</i>
<i>Don't take any unnecessary risks.</i>

229
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,666
<i>Just a reminder, ghosts are everywhere.</i>
<i>No need to go ghost-hunting.</i>

230
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,541
Hello.

231
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,750
Get me out of here.

232
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,166
Hey. Hey!

233
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:50,875
Can you hear me?

234
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:52,958
Get me out of here. Hey.

235
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,416
No one ever saw him again?

236
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,166
That Singaporean man?

237
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,166
This prison

238
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,458
has many stories.

239
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,416
Not only

240
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,125
does it lock people up,

241
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,791
but it locks up souls as well.

242
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:55,416
Someone met him,
but he could not speak English.

243
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,583
He only spoke Thai.

244
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,333
And he could not remember
all his life in Singapore.

245
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,000
As if

246
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,750
he was a different person.

247
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:13,916
Because

248
00:36:14,958 --> 00:36:18,500
they are completely different persons.

249
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,291
How is it possible?

250
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,708
Someone said that…

251
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,500
the soul that entered his body

252
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,541
is not his own.

253
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,250
So where is his soul now?

254
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,041
It seems like you're more interested

255
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,041
in the story

256
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:47,833
than the antique.

257
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:55,875
Are you interested
in these beautiful knives?

258
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,791
Try picking one.

259
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,041
How are those interesting?

260
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,166
It's just knives.

261
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,750
For you, it's just a knife.

262
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,250
But for its previous owner,

263
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:17,083
they are anger and revenge.

264
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,666
There is a Korean man.

265
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,083
All his life,

266
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,500
he only thinks about two things.

267
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:31,250
Anger and revenge.

268
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,500
And every time he wants to revenge,

269
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,416
he will buy a knife

270
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,791
and collect it.

271
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:45,791
So,

272
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,458
how many knives do you think
he has at home?

273
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:54,958
Five.

274
00:37:56,125 --> 00:38:00,416
No one knows how many knives
he has at home.

275
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,125
Once he gets revenge,

276
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,916
he will bring the knives
and sell them here.

277
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,958
Do you know how many knives I have?

278
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,958
Let me tell you the story.

279
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:26,958
Then you will know
how many knives there are.

280
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,833
Tonight is the second of February.

281
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,000
It's my birthday tomorrow.

282
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,125
At the party tomorrow…

283
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,625
there'll be three friends of mine
who ruined my life.

284
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:08,916
I want them…

285
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,500
to know the consequences…

286
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,333
of all the things…

287
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,166
they did to me.

288
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,750
Win, cut it out.

289
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,708
You're getting on my nerves, jackass.

290
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:26,416
Buy a new car, will you?
It's fucking hot in here.

291
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,333
If you want to sit in a comfy car,
why don't you take out your posh car?

292
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:34,916
You insisted I pick you up
and now you insult my car.

293
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,250
Fucking dumbass.

294
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,291
You're really angry, aren't you?
Big mouth is complaining.

295
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,666
-I'll shut your mouth with this.
-Fuck you.

296
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,916
-Asshole.
-It stinks. What the hell!

297
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,791
Shut up and buy a new car.

298
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,666
<i>I'm curious.</i>

299
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,916
<i>Why did he return to Thailand?</i>

300
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,375
Korea is a lot better.

301
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:09,541
Yeah. If I were him,
I'd never set foot here again.

302
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:13,708
Don't you think it's kind of weird?
We used to bully Song a lot back then.

303
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,833
Now he invites us to his birthday party.

304
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,125
What the fuck, Win!

305
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:21,666
Watch the road, bitch.

306
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,583
-Fuck you.
-I'll smack you again.

307
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,750
Sure you know how to drive?

308
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,541
This area looks so deserted.

309
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,458
There it is.

310
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,916
It's huge.

311
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:33,958
Where's everyone?

312
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,041
Follow her.

313
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,208
Bring them in.

314
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:58,875
Welcome.

315
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:01,458
Food is ready.

316
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,666
Nice to meet you.

317
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,458
I will set up the table.

318
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,250
Wait!

319
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,250
What about the others?

320
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:17,916
No.

321
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,333
Just you.

322
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,875
Lame. Watch this.

323
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,333
-Show off.
-Chill.

324
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,250
Guys,

325
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:38,458
this is weird.

326
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,041
I texted almost everyone.

327
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,500
No one knows about Song's birthday.

328
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,083
Tae,

329
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:50,250
back in high school,
he didn't have any friends.

330
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,166
We're probably his only friends.

331
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:55,708
Friends, my ass.

332
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,000
Don't you remember?

333
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,791
We made his life hell.

334
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:04,333
Tae, you're overthinking.

335
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,166
That was ages ago.

336
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,833
No one gives a damn now.

337
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:18,166
Damn it!

338
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:23,083
-Damn. So creepy.
-What's so fucking creepy?

339
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:24,250
Shit!

340
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:29,500
Hey!

341
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:31,875
Is dinner ready?

342
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,291
What the fuck!

343
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,375
Hey, girl.

344
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,625
Hey!

345
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,583
Can you hear me?

346
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,625
Why don't you invite some others
on your birthday?

347
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,875
If you have something to talk with us,

348
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:27,375
say it!

349
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:30,708
Hey!

350
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,833
Are you deaf?

351
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,791
We're asking you questions.

352
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,541
Should we beat him up now?
He's getting on my nerves.

353
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:45,958
Calm down, dude.

354
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,083
I want to clear up some issues

355
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,208
during the high school year.

356
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,041
It has been a long time.

357
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:01,291
We should talk about it.

358
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:05,541
So, there will be nothing left in my mind.

359
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,250
Hey.

360
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:12,833
I have nothing left in my mind.
But bullying you was fun.

361
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,833
Don't you think about inviting us

362
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,458
for revenge?

363
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,166
Just kidding, boy.

364
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:21,750
If you want to leave,

365
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,083
you should finish your steak first.

366
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,958
Fuck, it's like he's not human.

367
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,500
Why don't we beat him up now?

368
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,458
Tae, you're freaking out or what?

369
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,750
He cut himself and didn't even flinch.
Don't you think it's unusual?

370
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:27,750
Dude,

371
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:30,416
when we bullied him, he never screamed.

372
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,666
He's probably used to pain.

373
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:34,416
Agreed.

374
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,125
He knew

375
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,416
that if he winced or cried,

376
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,416
we would come down on him harder.

377
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:46,208
It became his habit
pretending he feels no pain.

378
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:47,125
Yeah.

379
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:53,208
I'll leave after I finish eating.

380
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:56,250
No fucking way.

381
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,541
We came together, so we'll leave together.

382
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,458
Tae, listen to me.

383
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:07,041
If he invited us here to get his revenge,

384
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:09,291
I'll beat him up before he gets a chance.

385
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:17,000
Do you remember
when I set his hair on fire?

386
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,750
-Yeah.
-One side of his head was scorched.

387
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:24,375
Of course I remember.
You shaved his head too.

388
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:27,416
And I took the photos.

389
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,000
Do you see now?

390
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:35,833
We are a great team.
Do you think he'll dare to get back at us?

391
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:38,500
You've just posted

392
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,333
an old photo of his shaved head
on the alumni's group.

393
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,291
I think it pissed him off.

394
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,166
If you're such a coward,

395
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:50,916
I can't stop you.

396
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:53,000
But don't try to scare us.

397
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,333
Hey! Calm down, Champ.

398
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,833
You know what he's like.

399
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,541
Hey.

400
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:09,916
What the fuck?

401
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:12,750
-Is it blood?
-What is it?

402
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:35,833
Where the hell is Song?

403
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,750
What's taking him so long?

404
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,458
I wonder what's up there.

405
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,083
Song!

406
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,083
-Hey!
-Song!

407
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:53,333
Fucking Song, where are you?

408
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,375
Whose blood is it?

409
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:04,541
Did you hear that?

410
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,583
Hey, girl!

411
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:23,416
Girl!

412
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:29,666
Girl!

413
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,125
Where did she go?

414
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,250
Song.

415
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,166
What the hell's with these balloons?

416
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,583
Fuck, is this really Song's house?

417
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,458
It doesn't look like someone lives here.

418
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,500
Guys, I think we should leave.

419
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,375
Not again.

420
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:23,750
I have a bad feeling.
Let's get out of here.

421
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,625
You're such a wimp.
Nothing's happened to us yet.

422
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,541
Hey!

423
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:34,791
Champ.

424
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:39,333
-I heard something.
-Champ. Come on.

425
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:43,916
Guys, I think I better leave now.

426
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,125
Come here. Stay close to me.

427
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:52,291
Don't get a heart attack, okay?

428
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:54,500
Here!

429
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:56,541
Fuck you, Win.

430
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,166
-Have a look.
-Leave me.

431
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,583
Fuck you guys. Cut it out, you two.

432
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,041
Come on, I'm sorry.

433
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,541
What are you so scared of?

434
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,625
-Hands off me.
-Easy, dude.

435
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,416
What did you just say? Wanna punch me?

436
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,666
Hey!

437
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,583
Fuck! Shit!

438
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:21,875
Fuck. What's this?

439
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:29,625
-Have some.
-You son of a bitch.

440
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,166
-Fuck you.
-Asshole.

441
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,541
Fuck!

442
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:40,291
Song!

443
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,166
Shit!

444
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,208
What the fuck is he saying?

445
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:48,541
When did he record it?

446
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,291
Yesterday.

447
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,958
If… he's dead,

448
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,916
then what we saw was his ghost?

449
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:19,583
He's not going to let us out of here.

450
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:22,541
Shut the fuck up, Tae.

451
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,333
Champ! What are you doing?

452
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:43,000
Making sure he's really dead.

453
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,708
Don't you see he's fucking bloody?

454
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:48,750
Shit! Who's that?

455
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Hey, Champ! Where are you going?

456
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,000
Hey, Champ!

457
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:55,750
Wait.

458
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,291
I saw Song over there.

459
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:07,166
Tae, you're delusional.
Song is lying dead in that room.

460
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:09,541
Where's that deaf girl?

461
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,541
Did you hear that?

462
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:18,791
Hear what?

463
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,875
His spirit is taking revenge on us.

464
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:24,708
Let's get out of here.

465
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,125
No way.

466
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,833
We have to call the cops
and give a statement.

467
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,875
You do it, but I'm leaving.

468
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:36,000
Fuck, get back here. Listen to me!

469
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:41,625
We'll tell the cops that when we got here
Song had already killed himself.

470
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,250
That easy, right?

471
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:47,416
And the dinner? How can you explain that?

472
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,791
But there's evidence that we've been here.

473
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,791
If we don't call the cops,
we'll look more suspicious.

474
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,625
Wait, Champ.

475
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:58,916
You're the only one who's left evidence.

476
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:03,208
You stabbed his leg.
You left your fingerprints there.

477
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,791
Come. We'll clean up downstairs.

478
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:09,291
No one will ever know we were here.

479
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:12,791
Asshole, you're dumping it on me?

480
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,083
You did it yourself!

481
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:16,583
-Fuck you!
-Bring it on, asshole.

482
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:17,500
Fuck you!

483
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,833
-Damn it!
-What the fuck!

484
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:31,708
-Hey!
-What?

485
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,333
Tae!

486
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,208
Where are you going?

487
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:00,333
I'm not going back in there.

488
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,541
Give it to me.

489
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,375
You two aren't going anywhere.
You must clean up this mess.

490
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,500
Fuck, you stay and talk to the cops.

491
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:13,291
Do you want it?

492
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:15,708
Take it.

493
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,083
But if you don't help me,

494
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,541
I'll tell the cops
what happened at that bar.

495
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,125
You.

496
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,666
Especially you.

497
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:27,833
You did something horrible.

498
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:30,083
If I'm going down,
you two are coming with me.

499
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:31,875
So,

500
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:33,166
you still want to leave?

501
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:38,875
I'll wipe off my fingerprints
from the knife.

502
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:42,666
You two clean up all the evidence here.

503
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,500
Then we'll leave together.

504
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,500
He killed himself
to become a ghost and haunt us.

505
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:53,375
Shut up or I'll turn you
into another ghost.

506
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,208
Hey!

507
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,541
Why did the lights go off?

508
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,583
See? I told you.

509
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:12,500
Champ!

510
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,666
Win!

511
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:16,875
Where are you?

512
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,125
Tae.

513
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:47,875
Where are you going?

514
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,291
Win!

515
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,333
Where are you?

516
01:00:58,750 --> 01:00:59,583
Hey!

517
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:06,500
Tae, where are you going?

518
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,666
Maybe he's looking for the fuse box.

519
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,458
Come upstairs with me.

520
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,666
What's with the darts?

521
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:45,166
-Let go.
-Tell me.

522
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:46,541
Let go.

523
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,791
What are they for?

524
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,958
Help me. Help!

525
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:56,666
Hey, Tae!

526
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:58,166
What's wrong?

527
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,333
Fuck you, Win.

528
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:50,750
Help me.

529
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,958
I'm so sorry.

530
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,125
Back then,

531
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:03,541
it was just fun.

532
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,833
I didn't mean to hurt you.

533
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,375
Champ was the one.

534
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,875
And the fire incident with your hair.

535
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,833
It was really an accident.

536
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,625
We only wanted to burn your clothes.

537
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,375
We didn't think it would get on your hair.

538
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,416
-Tae!
-Help me!

539
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:31,375
Help me!

540
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:34,000
-Tae, where are you?
-Help me!

541
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,000
-Tae.
-Help me!

542
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,083
Tae!

543
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,458
Calm down. I'm coming.

544
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:45,666
Help me.

545
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:55,291
Tae, relax. I'm here.

546
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:14,791
Help me, please. Help me!

547
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,666
You made me eat rotten things.

548
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:22,541
Remember?

549
01:06:57,625 --> 01:07:00,541
After that, you used a knife
to shave my hair.

550
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,500
Because you were scared
that the teacher would see.

551
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,125
You shaved without caring how much
the knife was cutting into my head.

552
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,375
My head was covered with blood.

553
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,750
Hear me out.

554
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,916
I can explain.

555
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:31,166
Help!

556
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:03,750
Hey!

557
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,958
Help me.

558
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,500
Help, please.

559
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:39,291
Keep running, boys.

560
01:09:44,458 --> 01:09:46,583
All of you will die today anyway.

561
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,041
Help me.

562
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:57,083
Help me.

563
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,333
Champ.

564
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:34,250
You want to die?

565
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,583
Let me help.

566
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,416
I'm not gonna die.

567
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,583
I'm not going easily.

568
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,166
Fun.

569
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:11,416
Right?

570
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:19,666
Win.

571
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:35,958
You're a murderer now.

572
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:49,000
What is

573
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,041
<i>in the food?</i>

574
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,208
Some herbs have

575
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,958
<i>hallucinatory effects.</i>

576
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:09,666
But some of them let you take fun trips
within your imagination.

577
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,000
What the fuck are you saying?

578
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:38,666
That won't hurt me.

579
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,083
You guys never knew I have a disorder.

580
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,000
I have never felt pain.

581
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:55,416
Every time you guys bullied me,

582
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,666
I never felt pain.

583
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:34,750
But I felt pain from the revenge.

584
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,666
That's the only pain I've got.

585
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,208
And you know what?

586
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,416
The most painful thing is…

587
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,208
the pain that is locked inside my heart.

588
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:00,500
Now

589
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,625
you have become a murderer.

590
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:08,708
You either die in jail or here.

591
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:37,458
Help me! Help me!

592
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:39,416
Help me!

593
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:41,041
Help me!

594
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,875
The police will be here soon.

595
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,416
I want to know what you're gonna do.

596
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:13,625
I…

597
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,750
I invited them to my birthday party.

598
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:20,125
They were so drunk.

599
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,250
Suddenly, one of them went crazy
and tried to kill everyone.

600
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:30,083
I managed to escape from him.

601
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:34,458
At the end, he just killed himself.

602
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,958
Sarge, there's another body here.

603
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:31,083
<i>Such illness really exists?</i>

604
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:36,083
The disorder that makes you
not feel anything?

605
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,458
Feeling nothing does not mean
you will not be in pain.

606
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,458
Why is there an extra cup?

607
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:51,625
Someone that we're thinking of

608
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:53,250
has arrived.

609
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,375
What brings you here again?

610
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:03,500
Sit first.

611
01:21:04,791 --> 01:21:06,166
Do you want a cup of tea?

612
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,458
I have something for you.

613
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,750
Alex, let's check.

614
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:56,208
You're the one who sold
those knives to Madame?

615
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,791
There are so many people
who sell knives to Madame.

616
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:10,541
But not everyone seems close with Madame.

617
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:14,291
I see.

618
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,625
Madame has already told you
about my story.

619
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:25,041
It's a way to create value
for the antiques.

620
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,375
Which means it's not true.

621
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:36,708
Was it fun?

622
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:44,958
Very interesting.

623
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,958
So interesting that you forgot
to go to the airport.

624
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:53,875
-I'm late!
-Wait.

625
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,375
Will you bring something back with?

626
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,000
I would like to have this bracelet.

627
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,333
I think he wants to go home.

628
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:14,791
It may be torturing for him to stay here.

629
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,833
Between the torture of being trapped,

630
01:23:22,958 --> 01:23:24,583
and the torture from being hurt,

631
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,583
which do you think is the most painful?

632
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:39,416
The torture of not being able
to break free from the pain.

633
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,083
That is most painful.

634
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,333
Okay.

635
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,666
I will put it in a box for you.

636
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:13,791
Hope to see you again.

637
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,208
You're the first person

638
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,708
who wants to see me again.

639
01:24:54,208 --> 01:24:55,041
Pick one.

640
01:24:56,416 --> 01:24:58,625
I will tell you a story.

641
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:29,833
