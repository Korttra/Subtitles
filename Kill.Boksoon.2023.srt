00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,048
<i>It's cold.</i>

4
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>Did I leave the hotel window open?</i>

5
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,746
Hello, Sir,

6
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,164
Are you awake now?

7
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,760
Hey!

8
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,639
Do you have any idea
who you’re dealing with right now?

9
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:42,185
Oda Shinichiro,
a second-generation <i>zainichi.</i>

10
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,437
Your Korean name is Kim Gwang-il.

11
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,816
You got here three days ago
for some sightseeing.

12
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,151
Did someone from Nagoya
send you then?

13
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,987
Or was it Sakaguchi from Tokyo?

14
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,116
Or maybe Mr. Choi from Busan?

15
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,034
I see that you're wanted.

16
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,203
Gwang-il,

17
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,831
you should've lived a better life

18
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,000
if you wanted to a die natural death,

19
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,168
with all due respect.

20
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,884
I've heard of you, all right.

21
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,139
A ruthless, female assassin
from the Korean peninsula.

22
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,018
The rumors must be true
if they sent you to deal with me alone,

23
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,147
Oda Shinichiro, the infamous Kansai tiger.

24
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,024
Pretentious, like all the yakuza.

25
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,819
Hey, this is just the pride of a samurai.

26
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,112
Of course.

27
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,239
The pride of a samurai.

28
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,742
I still don't get it.

29
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,536
That is

30
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,998
why did you wait for me to wake up?

31
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,417
I was going to kill you earlier,

32
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,836
but I changed my mind, sir.

33
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,883
I would like to hear the story,
if it isn't too long.

34
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,885
Well, all right.

35
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,720
I'll just tell it like it is.

36
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,264
I have a daughter.

37
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,810
<i>She takes after me,</i>
<i>so she's a really pretty girl.</i>

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,023
What?

39
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>That aside,</i>
<i>she can be pretty rude sometimes.</i>

40
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,320
Anyway, we were watching
the news one weekend.

41
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,448
<i>Senator Oh Jeong-sik,</i>
<i>the new candidate for prime minister,</i>

42
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,659
<i>is currently refuting all claims</i>
<i>that his son was fraudulently admitted</i>

43
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,494
<i>into a college of music.</i>

44
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,123
<i>Meanwhile, the prosecution has</i>
<i>just recently summoned the senator's son</i>

45
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,792
<i>so that they may begin the investigation.</i>

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,336
These people, honestly.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,004
Hmm.

48
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,299
If it got their kid into a good school,
they'd do that.

49
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,176
Come on.

50
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,305
Listen.

51
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,725
You know I'm not saying
what he did was right.

52
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,436
I'm just saying as a parent,
I understand why he did it.

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,647
I don't think that's fair.

54
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,274
Nothing people do is.

55
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,863
If that kid is the one that got admitted,
then another didn't.

56
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,701
What if I was that kid?
Would you be saying the same thing then?

57
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,790
If I was a mom,

58
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,084
I'd teach my kid
to have fair competitions,

59
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,628
instead of going on
about how unfair the world is.

60
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,422
<i>She sounds exceptional.</i>

61
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,674
You know,

62
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,260
we can really learn things from our kids.

63
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,302
Yes, we can.

64
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,223
So that's why
I'm competing fairly today.

65
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,978
Are you sure?

66
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,312
I think you'll regret it.

67
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,697
I see!

68
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,660
I'm not the only samurai here, huh?

69
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,163
How about some clothes
so I can fight with decency?

70
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,290
Cut it out.

71
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,919
If you're cold, just say so.

72
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,674
Your sword looks old.
You want something new instead?

73
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,842
Well,

74
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,263
a lady wouldn't know much
about swords, now would she?

75
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,856
Four hundred years ago,
this was forged by

76
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,151
the greatest swordsmith
of the Edo shogunate.

77
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,444
This is

78
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,404
an Akihiro katana.

79
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,241
Samurais consider,

80
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,871
this to be like the Holy Grail.

81
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,499
What do you say?

82
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,461
Impressive, is it not?

83
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,177
I bought this thing online today.

84
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,311
Ooh, ho!

85
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:57,732
Ooh-hoo!

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,321
Let's see.

87
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,450
How about we begin, huh?

88
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,833
Oh, ooh!

89
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,320
You're good.

90
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,780
Hmm, I know.

91
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,649
Be proud of your work today.

92
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,444
There are only three people

93
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,280
who can last this long
against Oda Shinichiro

94
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,783
out of all the fighters in Japan.

95
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,542
Hoo.

96
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,295
-Are you giving up?
-One sec, huh?

97
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,591
-Let me switch this.
-Not a problem.

98
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,976
There's no coincidences in winning.

99
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,772
A thousand days to forge a spirit…

100
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,613
…and 10,000 days to remind yourself!

101
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,989
Ah!

102
00:08:55,701 --> 00:09:00,414
And only
after this rigorous conditioning--

103
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,346
Oh, you bitch.

104
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,556
Sorry.

105
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,350
The supermarket's about to close.

106
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:55,219
KILL BOKSOON

107
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,575
Oh no.

108
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,160
When did you get this wilted?

109
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,912
You should've told Mommy sooner.

110
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,555
My daughter, Boksoon,
has been smoking.

111
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,560
It was a misdeed committed
by a curious young child.

112
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,980
Forgive me my sins, oh Lord,

113
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:52,109
just as I have forgiven
the sins of my daughter.

114
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,028
Amen.

115
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,029
Amen.

116
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,410
Take this.

117
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,166
Eat it.

118
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,679
Swallow it.

119
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,448
You're home late.

120
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
I found your cigarettes.

121
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,583
Nothing good comes from smoking.
Why not just drink?

122
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,835
Don't smoke.

123
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,133
That's like telling me to watch the lights
when you're jaywalking.

124
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,719
Great argument, though. Seriously.

125
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,565
I found your cigarettes.

126
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,819
Wanna have a smoke?

127
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,363
You're not that cool, Mom.

128
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,292
That's it. I'm gonna kill her.

129
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,253
Gil Jae-young!

130
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,838
I'm sorry for slamming a door.

131
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,964
I won't smoke again.

132
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,846
What is it?

133
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,514
Something else?

134
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,726
Uh, no.

135
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,478
I just wanted your opinion,

136
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,522
you know, for what I should wear tomorrow.

137
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,523
Ah.

138
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,442
The educational meeting.

139
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,487
Isn't that just

140
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,282
a lunch with all those private-school moms
who discuss their kids and assets?

141
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
That's what I've been saying.

142
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,998
There's a reason that everyone
goes to the U.S. mainland.

143
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,000
We went to Hawaii last year.

144
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,420
There were decent enough meals
and lots to see.

145
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,547
There are just so many tourists now.

146
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,257
-The kids can't work on their Korean.
-Mmm.

147
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,177
That's why people send their kids
to camps in Singapore these days.

148
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,595
Oh no, don't.

149
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,388
That's where average kids go.

150
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,266
Classes are poor there.

151
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,559
Oh.

152
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,313
So then, where should we
send our kids to?

153
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,899
Oh, that's right, because this summer
you and Jae-young

154
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,359
didn't end up going away.

155
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,693
This summer, you mean?

156
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,611
Mm-hmm.

157
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,489
Ah, that's right.

158
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,241
I had to travel for business.

159
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,458
I'm sure it's harder for you
since you're on your own.

160
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,876
Hmm.

161
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,087
This year I plan on letting her travel.

162
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,174
Actually, So-ra has said
I should look out for Jae-young.

163
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,884
Mmm.

164
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,263
But remind me. What do you do again?

165
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,184
Mmm, just event planning, actually.

166
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,603
Uh, event planning?

167
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,272
What kind?

168
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>Earlier this morning</i>
<i>in Seoul, a man in his 40s</i>

169
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,654
<i>was found dead from a gunshot wound,</i>
<i>lying in the middle of the road.</i>

170
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,033
<i>He was identified</i>
<i>as the Japanese-born Korean Kim Gwang-il</i>

171
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,952
<i>who arrived to Korea three days ago.</i>

172
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,802
See?
She didn't stick to the script again.

173
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,722
Using a gun in a domestic show?

174
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,056
How do we clean that up, hmm?

175
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>The Japanese government</i>
<i>has yet to make an official…</i>

176
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,936
Well I'm not convinced she shouldn't have.

177
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,022
Why?

178
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,275
<i>As you all know,</i>
<i>gun-related crimes are uncommon in Korea.</i>

179
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,653
<i>Considering that fact,</i>
<i>this was likely the result</i>

180
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>of the Japanese yakuza power struggle</i>
<i>going on.</i>

181
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,117
<i>And if Korean gangs were involved in this…</i>

182
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,118
There.

183
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,121
Who'd suspect the wife
of the cheating yakuza

184
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,623
when they have all this?

185
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,583
Please.

186
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,461
You're always so weak
when you deal with her.

187
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,547
<i>The victim was</i>
<i>a second-generation Japanese-born Korean.</i>

188
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,051
<i>Oda Shinichiro,</i>
<i>also known in Korea as Kim Gwang-il…</i>

189
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,070
Hey.

190
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,782
Grab a seat.

191
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,911
This…
This could cut through rock like butter.

192
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,498
Boksoon, you have all of my respect.

193
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,582
You have fun with it?

194
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,793
Yes!

195
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,544
Um, Boksoon,

196
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,630
do you think that one day

197
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,423
I could pull off a show like yours

198
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,967
that ends up on the news?

199
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,844
You're still too young.

200
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,015
Right. Keep you head up, Yun-seok.
Our generation will get its chance.

201
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,851
Maybe in the 23rd century.

202
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,646
Is Min-seok coming?

203
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,481
Oh, he died.

204
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,775
Business trip in China.

205
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,653
Ah. I promised I'd buy his dinner.

206
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,864
Enough about the dead.
Bring us up to speed on the show.

207
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,201
Tell us. Was that yakuza
all he was hyped up to be?

208
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,619
Was he a good fighter?

209
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,246
How was he?

210
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,206
Mmm…

211
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,332
He was good.

212
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,043
-I might have lost in a fair fight.
-Hey…

213
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,963
Ah. I'm old, aren't I?

214
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,132
-No way. Stop it, Boksoon.
-Hey!

215
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,093
Still, what does it matter
if they can fight?

216
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,720
It's not like it's a competition.

217
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,139
Find their weakness, you win.

218
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,682
Or you make one so you don't lose.

219
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,559
As Kill Boksoon once said,

220
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,436
"Find the person's weakness."

221
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,521
"And if there is none, make one, then."

222
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,647
Yeah.

223
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,691
What's with this guy? Every time…

224
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,235
I learn from you once again, Boksoon.

225
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,320
Aw, my little Gwang-man, really?

226
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,156
-That's so gross.
-What an idiot.

227
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,452
Hey, with a show this big,
what are you expecting to get paid?

228
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,871
Enough to cover everyone's drinks tonight.

229
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,206
Oh, it'll stay between us. Huh?

230
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,333
If you'd rather not say it,

231
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,420
then just write the first digit.

232
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,672
Uh…

233
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,557
You make more with your company
off one show than I do at mine with seven.

234
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,977
That's 'cause MK is a global conglomerate,
and yours is not.

235
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,438
Still, you're working.
Consider yourself lucky.

236
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,192
I have no company, so now I can't.

237
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,318
Yeah, well,

238
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,196
that's because of those strict rules
MK made.

239
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,532
Isn't it?

240
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,203
There's an old saying.

241
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,579
SEVEN YEARS AGO

242
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:05,459
"Killing a man will save you from having
to have patience and tolerance."

243
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,674
Those of us gathered here this evening
are the professionals who put those words

244
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,093
into action.

245
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,970
We do not answer
to the local detective agency.

246
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:22,559
Nor are we those old-fashioned mobsters
in tacky suits playing games of rank.

247
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,064
There is pride in our work.

248
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,857
Killing

249
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,153
is now a global business,
and we've earned respect,

250
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,782
until those unemployed amateurs

251
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,367
ruined our reputation.

252
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,454
They went as far as killing children
for a couple million.

253
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,042
Who does that?

254
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,002
How did they fall so low?

255
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,964
The reason we're
in such an unfortunate situation

256
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,759
is because we don't regulate our business.

257
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,053
And that

258
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,558
is why there is a set of rules
we should have in place.

259
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,352
I have a question.

260
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,900
If we agree to all these rules
and pick and choose who to kill,

261
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,735
won't we be the ones losing work?

262
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,321
That would only benefit the unemployed.

263
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,615
I assume you're the one
who recently affiliated.

264
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,661
For now, it's just us.

265
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,496
I'm Sergeant Shin, sir.

266
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,415
You raise a good point.

267
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,000
For that,

268
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,128
the rules we create need to be

269
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,713
difficult to adhere to

270
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,506
for the others,

271
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,509
allowing us to remove the unaffiliated.

272
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,305
Now, we'll have three in place.

273
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,265
The first,

274
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,351
you are never to kill anyone underage.

275
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,270
Second,

276
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,315
you will only take on shows
sanctioned by your company.

277
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,274
Third,

278
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,737
you must attempt shows sanctioned
by you company.

279
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,073
If you agree to these three rules,

280
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:00,991
those others,

281
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,410
these amateur killers

282
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,163
will be exiled just like that.

283
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,040
And it'll be us.

284
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,375
You can count me in!

285
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,752
That's it!

286
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,503
Friend, count me in!

287
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,635
I didn't know back then
that I'd lose this hand

288
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,969
and my company too.

289
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,804
We went under

290
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,098
just trying to stick to those rules.

291
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,518
And there was no severance. Damn it.

292
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,646
All right, here's a thought.

293
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,233
Why is it that all the rules
are made by those in power?

294
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,818
Beep. Time's up.
The right answer is because rules

295
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,403
make those in power
even more powerful.

296
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:43,200
Those rules were just a way for MK
to monopolize the industry. Were they not?

297
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,118
Think about it.
Other than Sergeant Shin's crew,

298
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,204
all the other companies
became hole in the walls.

299
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,747
They're walking on eggshells.

300
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,998
You're with MK.

301
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,625
That's why. That's how I know.

302
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,670
They rank us how they want.

303
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,422
They choose our order
so only the rich become richer,

304
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,008
while the rest of us
are forced to be grateful

305
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,135
for the meager crumbs they leave us.

306
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,012
Okay.

307
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,848
Your skill level is
what determines how you're paid.

308
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,943
Wow.

309
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,946
That sounded like you're implying
I'm not good enough.

310
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,949
I'm not still some kid
that follows you around.

311
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,704
Well, why don't you send me
a bloody knife then

312
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,706
so I can see your progress?

313
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey, stop talking about bloody knives.
You're scaring us.

314
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,339
But still, it's true.

315
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,300
MK has made it hard

316
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,510
for those like us to work.

317
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,428
Hmm.

318
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,804
Yeah.

319
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
So I'm the bitch here? Is that it?

320
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,562
If they recruited you,
would you turn down MK?

321
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,982
Blaming others
as you wallow in your self-pity

322
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,192
is what incompetent people choose to do.

323
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,490
I'm sorry, everyone.
I guess I'm just a little too competent.

324
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:15,000
Hey, by the way, what does
it mean to send someone a bloody knife?

325
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,294
It's a time-honored message.

326
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,255
Something that existed
before the talk of any rules.

327
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,465
For example,

328
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,510
let's say you send him
a knife with blood smeared on it.

329
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,846
That means that you've asked

330
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,766
that he set a time and location
to fight to the death.

331
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,392
Ah.

332
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,228
<i>Those romantic notions</i>
<i>are a thing of the past.</i>

333
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,939
<i>Those were the days</i>
<i>when Boksoon was in her prime.</i>

334
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,982
<i>And I mean,</i>

335
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,942
<i>she was crazy scary back then.</i>

336
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,403
This car isn't fully loaded.

337
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,865
Move.

338
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,742
Ooh.

339
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,994
Hey, hey,
look at this prissy ass bitch here.

340
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,664
Hey, you pigs.

341
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,083
What?

342
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,586
What the fuck did you way?

343
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,922
-You fucking bitch.
-Chill. Don't be like that. Don't.

344
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,215
Come on.

345
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,258
That's a rude name to be calling people.

346
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,470
One pig, two pig,
three pig, four pig, five pigs.

347
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,223
-Well?
-You bitch, you just-<i>-</i>

348
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,516
Ah!

349
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,477
<i>But in all honesty,</i>
<i>don't you think someone like Hee-sung</i>

350
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,479
<i>should be ranked in A, even at MK?</i>

351
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,982
<i>I mean, the weight of his name aside,</i>
<i>I think he could compete with Boksoon.</i>

352
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,110
<i>His skills are clearly good enough.</i>

353
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,904
<i>He was once considered</i>
<i>a rising star at MK.</i>

354
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:30,200
<i>But for whatever reason,</i>
<i>he got on Chairman Cha Min-kyu's bad side.</i>

355
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,426
There's no blood on it.

356
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,060
Oh, wait, I'm getting so close.

357
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,603
Can we change positions?

358
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,981
No, wait a minute. I'm enjoying this.

359
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,703
<i>Are you really going to quit?</i>

360
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,331
<i>Smoking is a requirement</i>
<i>for our miserable teenage years.</i>

361
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,084
<i>What's got you so miserable?</i>

362
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,961
<i>Everything besides you.</i>

363
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,422
<i>Intense school life.</i>

364
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,091
<i>My stupid boyfriend.</i>

365
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,552
And really my mom.

366
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,264
She'd kill me
if she knew about us doing this.

367
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,474
It's stifling.

368
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,685
Do you know what my mom
put my name as in her phone?

369
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,312
-Don't tell me.
-"Pwincess."

370
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,771
No way.

371
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,899
Moms are all the same.

372
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,776
They act like they love us,

373
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,446
But they'd freak out
if they knew this about us.

374
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,616
Yeah, it's whatever.

375
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,578
I don't really know my mom either.

376
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,079
She hides a lot from me.

377
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,664
Like?

378
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,292
It's nothing.

379
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,460
What is it?

380
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,921
Are you hiding something from…

381
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,302
Hey, kids!

382
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,514
Don't you know
you shouldn't skip class to smoke?

383
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:18,975
Hi.

384
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,772
A smoke after trig. Man, it's everything.

385
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,275
We're going to karaoke.

386
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,779
-We got beer and everything.
-Awesome.

387
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,073
What about you?

388
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,741
You guys go ahead.

389
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,827
Hey.

390
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,205
You should join us, huh?

391
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,710
I'll kill you.

392
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,340
See you tomorrow.

393
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,052
Wow, poor Cheol-woo.

394
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,513
Ah, she rejected you again, huh?

395
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,307
Hey, wasn't Gil Jae-young
freaking scary just now?

396
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,475
I know, right?

397
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,271
Oh! He's scared.
What a freaking pussy.

398
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,191
-Hey, shitbag, what did you say?
-Hey, come on. Hey!

399
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,694
You know he throws a fit
when you call him pussy.

400
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,587
What is this?

401
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,673
-It's for your dad's surgery.
-Ah…

402
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,342
It feels weird getting money now.

403
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,845
I appreciate it, but I can't.

404
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,889
Instead, can you stay a little longer?
Huh?

405
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,225
I'm not giving it to you.
You'll pay me back.

406
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,936
Don't need it.
I've already taken care of it.

407
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,354
You what?

408
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,398
You're concerned, huh?

409
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,192
-So you wanna to know how I did it?
-No.

410
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,987
If I'll have to fix it,
I don't wanna hear it.

411
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,948
Boksoon!

412
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,866
Boksoon!

413
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,326
Gil Boksoon!

414
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,329
Just admit it.

415
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,122
Just say that you worry about me.

416
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,291
If you're really worried about me,

417
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,585
you can set up a company
and take me with you.

418
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,754
Your contract's ending soon, right?

419
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,422
Recklessness isn't attractive.

420
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,300
If you started your own company,
it would take off.

421
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,469
I like Chairman Cha, all right?

422
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,723
That man taught me everything that I know,

423
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,642
and he gave me everything I have.

424
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,146
And he's the one
who could take everything away from you.

425
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,651
Will you kill me
if Chairman Cha orders you to?

426
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,451
Why'd I even ask?

427
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,454
I might quit once my contract ends.

428
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,666
What for? Why?

429
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,098
Did you get a boyfriend?

430
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,974
Yeah right.

431
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,604
If you were nicer, I'm sure
a lot of boys would want to date you.

432
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,405
Don't you have a debate for class?
I heard it counts toward your grade.

433
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,074
It's childish to make kids
fight against each other for a grade.

434
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,826
Hmm. Debate is fighting.

435
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,206
If your opponent flinches
when it's their turn,

436
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,457
that's their weakness.

437
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,127
Then you destroy them
with everything that you've got.

438
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,129
I thought you just said to be nicer.

439
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,969
So what's the debate about?

440
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,389
It's about who should be
on the 100,000-won bill, if we had it.

441
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,057
Mmm. That sounds great.

442
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,684
Who did you choose?

443
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,602
There were a lot of candidates.

444
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,146
Gwanggaeto the Great,

445
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,523
Eulji Mundeok, Kim Gu, An Jung-guen…

446
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,567
I noticed something with all of them.

447
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,777
-They're all men, right?
-No, besides that.

448
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,196
They've killed someone, you know?

449
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,199
So I chose Nongae the Courtesan.

450
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,952
Women aren't really known for killing,
so I liked her.

451
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,246
Hmm.

452
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,581
You're right.

453
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,460
It’s an interesting perspective to have.

454
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,399
Oh my God. Gil Boksoon!

455
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,818
Hey. Take it easy.

456
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,486
<i>Unni, </i>what are you doing here?

457
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,863
The chairman called me.

458
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,365
It's great you're here.

459
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,075
Come help me out with this class, <i>Unni.</i>

460
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,743
No, forget it. It's embarrassing.

461
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,746
Oh. Come on, <i>Unni. </i>Just this once.

462
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,874
-Uh, no, I'm not doing it.
-Come on.

463
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,391
Ah!

464
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,232
Ah!

465
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,406
Ah!

466
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,304
Ay.

467
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,144
Good morning, Director Cha.

468
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,821
No way.

469
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,074
Hello!

470
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,535
I was told
you were having your evaluations,

471
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,496
so I wanted to cheer you all on.

472
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,915
Gil Boksoon, you're so cool!

473
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,751
This looks familiar, yeah?

474
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,879
Hmm. They're recreating
your show from five years ago.

475
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,298
-Ah.
-The one in the Yeosu urinal.

476
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,427
-A girl?
-Mm-hmm.

477
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,514
Hmm.
Girls are really excelling these days.

478
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,100
She's the top
of this group. She'll debut soon.

479
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,643
Ah, is that so?

480
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,895
Hello, I'm Kim Young-ji, miss.

481
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,563
How come you're so nervous?

482
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,483
She says you're her hero.

483
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,027
And I'll turn her
into the next Gil Boksoon.

484
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,822
Hmm. I bet.

485
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,199
Watch, huh?

486
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,829
So who wants to spar with Kim Young-ji?

487
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,250
-If you do, you might really die.
-No takers?

488
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,584
Wow.

489
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,169
You must be really good.

490
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,548
Next time I'll see.

491
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,925
Good luck!

492
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,844
Too bad you can't stay.

493
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,304
She's probably better
than you were at that age.

494
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,018
Young-ji?

495
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,855
Do you have a second to spar?

496
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,872
You're not using a weapon?

497
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,000
You're not using real knives, are you?

498
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,128
This is good.

499
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,007
Okay… start!

500
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,571
-Ah!
-Ooh!

501
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,079
Two hands are good,
but your moves are too obvious.

502
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,206
Huh.

503
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,418
I never fought like that at her age,
did I?

504
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,720
Good choice.

505
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,024
Whoa!

506
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,110
Hoo.

507
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,912
Uh-huh.

508
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,808
If this was a real blade, you'd be cut.

509
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,019
Oh!

510
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,772
She remind you of young Boksoon a little?

511
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,732
I was prettier.

512
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,736
Ah!

513
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,282
Huh?

514
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,869
You were just murdered

515
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,413
before you could make a sound.

516
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,420
Oh.

517
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,304
Take your pick.
Both shows are urgent requests,

518
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,306
so things need to be decided quickly.

519
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,475
Hmm.

520
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,562
Sugar?

521
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,065
-I'm sorry, miss. I'll get you a new one.
-Ah, no.

522
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,067
I'm not really in the mood.

523
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,070
That'll be all.

524
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,536
What's this about? Tired?

525
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,747
I just finished a show, as you know.

526
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,541
And I should give others a chance too.

527
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,295
Like Hee-sung.
He's been training. He can take this one.

528
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,714
These are A assignments.

529
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,424
He's good enough to be ranked A.

530
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,259
That's my decision, not yours.

531
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,887
Hmm.

532
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,931
Then I choose…

533
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,184
Another domestic one. You didn't read it.

534
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,394
I'm feeling more patriotic these days.

535
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,024
Right.

536
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,945
Then it looks like
I'll be visiting Russia, thanks to you.

537
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,573
Wow, it must be some show
if you're taking it on yourself.

538
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,033
A mafia case.

539
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,580
Since Dokgo retired
and Mantis is on vacation…

540
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,290
Hmm.

541
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,877
…well, that just leaves you or me.

542
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,679
Have you thought about contract renewal?

543
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,018
Your kid is fifteen now, isn't she?

544
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,146
Don't forget

545
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,857
what you promised me back then.

546
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,695
And I'm telling you that isn't it.

547
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,700
Let's go eat.

548
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,244
Gives us some time to catch up.

549
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,413
I had breakfast already.

550
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,041
-Let's get <i>tteokbokki.</i>
-Really?

551
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,042
Mmm.

552
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,505
Only for <i>tteokbokki.</i>

553
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,892
Director Cha.

554
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,145
I have the documents you requested.

555
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,607
You can just leave them over there for me.

556
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,403
What are you looking at down there?

557
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,200
Something awful.

558
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,789
She used to follow me
around when I came home,

559
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,166
and she'd tell me about school,

560
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,043
even what they had for lunch that day.

561
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,712
Now she's always
in her room with the door closed.

562
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,506
She has all these secrets.
Her phone is password-protected.

563
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,883
Keeping secrets, it…

564
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,844
It means she's creating a wall.

565
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,762
About that.

566
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,305
A wall?

567
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,142
Everything that you taught me
when I started training,

568
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,312
find your opponent's weakness,
their next move,

569
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,980
and catch them off guard,

570
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,690
none of that works on her.

571
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,733
No?

572
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,485
She's tough.

573
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,613
Killing other people is easier
than raising a kid.

574
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,782
You're right.

575
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,910
And you can earn good money too.

576
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,372
So why, then?

577
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,166
The contract renewal…

578
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,126
What do you need?

579
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,798
The <i>tteokbokki</i>'s really nice.

580
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,427
If it's not because of your kid,
then what's behind it?

581
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,929
Huh?

582
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,599
What? You worried God'll smite us?

583
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,767
You and I,

584
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,729
we're already going to hell
without a doubt.

585
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,107
That's why we don't talk to God.

586
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,573
-It's a kid.
-He's not a minor.

587
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,159
But why is it an A-level show?

588
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,079
It's gonna be the talk of the town.

589
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,790
It has to look like it was suicide.

590
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,672
Like when we met, isn't it?

591
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,427
I don't recall.

592
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,429
That memory's been gathering dust.

593
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,187
Ah. Hello, sir. How are you?

594
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:44,817
She…

595
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,529
Is Jae-young okay?

596
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,411
Yes, uh, I'll be there in a minute.

597
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,455
What's going on?

598
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,456
Uh…

599
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,001
Jae-young stabbed a classmate
with a pair of scissors.

600
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,295
That means she takes after you,
apparently.

601
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,593
It's just a joke.

602
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,304
Don't joke about that.

603
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,433
You even think about
joking like that again,

604
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,228
you'll find the world's dullest knife
stuck down your throat.

605
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,361
We've been told that Jae-young
was talking to Cheol-woo during the break

606
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,821
when she stabbed him,

607
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,033
but the issue is
neither he nor your daughter

608
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,744
will tell us
the exact reason this happened.

609
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:41,040
I mean,
does the victim need a reason?

610
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,626
My Cheol-woo is the victim here!

611
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,503
I know. I'm sorry.

612
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,463
And I'll cover everything.

613
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,589
His hospital bills…

614
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,799
Forget it.
You think I don't have the money?

615
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,510
Just get the police in here.

616
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,221
Our kids were fighting
and you want police for that?

617
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,723
She stuck scissors right into his neck!

618
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,644
<i>If the wound was any deeper,</i>
<i>it would have been fatal</i>,

619
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:07,525
'cause she… 'cause she had clearly
planned on killing my son today.

620
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,487
I can't even imagine
what she's learning at home.

621
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,448
That's enough. That's uncalled for.

622
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,533
Is it?

623
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,494
You shouldn't be taking sides
just because your daughters are friends!

624
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,163
I'm not taking Jae-young's side here.

625
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,500
Listen, I'm just here today
as a committee parent.

626
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:29,088
Uh, we called you here today
as So-ra was the only witness.

627
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,881
She won't say anything, though.

628
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,592
Wait. So-ra was involved
in this horrible incident?

629
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,761
No, I didn't say that.

630
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,931
Anyway, Miss Gil, it's one week

631
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,975
until Jae-young can return to class.

632
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,143
She attacked Cheol-woo.
She should be kicked out!

633
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,479
After the week, we will hold
a school discipline committee,

634
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,940
and if the reason for it is still unclear,

635
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:52,194
well then, according to the rules here,
Gil Jae-young is expelled.

636
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,445
You can't!

637
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,741
They're kicking you out unless you talk.

638
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,622
No amount of money
could get you back in after that.

639
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,834
You think you can handle
public school after going here?

640
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,960
Just cut it out.

641
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,461
You sound like a philistine.

642
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,424
A philistine?!

643
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,050
So what? You were right, then?

644
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,594
Stabbing people is cultured?

645
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,762
That boy could've died, Jae-young!

646
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,517
Do you know how dangerous what you did is?

647
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,977
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,563
What was that?

649
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,189
I wanted Cheol-woo to die.

650
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,409
<i>The first time I killed someone,</i>
<i>I was 17.</i>

651
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,621
That was when I first met Chairman Cha.

652
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,706
He said I was a natural.

653
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,586
It made sense since I grew up
with so much violence.

654
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:56,216
That's why I wanted to raise her
in a way that was opposite to that.

655
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,053
But sometimes when I look at her,

656
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,556
she reminds me of my younger self,
and that's what scares me.

657
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,768
Ah, you're reading too much into it.

658
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,271
Ah, she's going through puberty.

659
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,815
She could've just said that
to be rebellious.

660
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,401
Isn't she at that age?

661
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,195
Look, how about

662
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,907
you tell the chairman
the truth about the renewal?

663
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,327
The chairman will let you go
if it's for your kid.

664
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,455
Or he'll have you killed.

665
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,710
I made him a promise
when I decided to have Jae-young,

666
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,672
that I wouldn't let it affect the work.

667
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,052
It's more emotionally challenging
than I thought it'd be.

668
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,973
Look, I mean…

669
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,104
whenever I see myself
in a victim's eyes as they die…

670
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,276
I'm afraid to come home
and then have her look at me.

671
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,488
Yeah, if I think about my dad
finding out what I'm doing right now,

672
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,906
it makes my skin crawl.

673
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,118
I'm selfish,

674
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,202
'cause I won't quit.

675
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,080
I don't want to give this up for her.

676
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,833
Am I unqualified to be a mother?

677
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,711
Making good money
is a great qualification.

678
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,214
I mean, look,

679
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,174
I also don't want to…

680
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,093
…give this up for my dad,

681
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,303
even though my work

682
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,556
is menial right now at best.

683
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,562
It's really ironic
to be a mother and a killer.

684
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,278
Aren't there lessons in killing?

685
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,489
The world is full of irony.

686
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,783
We start wars for peace.

687
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,286
We want truth. We believe lies.

688
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,039
And killers gather

689
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,000
and they make the rules.

690
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,710
Hey.

691
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,546
You're writing a novel now?

692
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,966
Wanna publish it? Huh?

693
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:01,967
I'll let you.

694
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,014
<i>Truth in Contradictions.</i>

695
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:09,975
That's the title.

696
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,144
And…

697
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,857
the truth is you're definitely a good mom.

698
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,275
See? Even now

699
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,902
you're here thinking about her

700
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,237
instead of how to kill.

701
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,619
By the way, didn't you bring anything?

702
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,330
I mean, what kind of person visits
their junior on the set

703
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,123
and comes empty-handed?

704
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,085
Wow. It passed
from the main artery to the lumbar.

705
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,879
Would you look at that?

706
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,798
Ah.

707
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,049
Look at the detail.

708
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,220
These are
all unsolved murder cases from the police.

709
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,638
Quite a lot, aren't there?

710
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,016
All were disguised
as involuntary manslaughter.

711
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,518
Look closer.

712
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,270
This is definitely
the work of a professional.

713
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,189
So they're unsanctioned shows, huh?

714
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,859
-Is that what you're implying?
-Precisely.

715
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,737
All other chairmen
have come forward to say

716
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,280
these aren't their companies' either.

717
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,867
So you're saying
that this is the work of the unemployed?

718
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,744
This work is too good to be theirs.

719
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,792
Then it's the work
of someone who got fired.

720
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,669
Or an employee and we didn't know.

721
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,878
Ah, no.

722
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,547
There's no way.

723
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,714
It couldn't be though.

724
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,383
It can't be that.

725
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,093
Actually, it can.

726
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,136
Yeah, it could be.

727
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,847
A good chance.

728
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,308
The police said
that they're looking into it all,

729
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,726
so we'll have an answer.

730
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,103
On the off chance

731
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,606
that it's one of our employees
who is behind it,

732
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:40,983
I would like

733
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,151
for those of us at MK

734
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,696
to handle their punishment.

735
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,741
If my kid steps out of line,

736
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,451
then, yeah, I should handle it.

737
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,246
It feels awful when they're

738
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,831
punished by somebody else.

739
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,084
Companies ignore
disobedient employees, though.

740
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,462
This whole room knows about that.

741
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,801
We've been given an opportunity here
to write some wrongs in the process.

742
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,720
What do you mean?

743
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:12,973
I'm scared.

744
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,435
How will we ever make it?

745
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,896
How will we survive

746
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,608
pushing our employees like that load
you're pushing from your anus?

747
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,903
Sergeant Shin,

748
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,658
you should reenlist
if your company is too much for you,

749
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,704
instead of airing
your incompetence to the room.

750
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,752
There's no evidence of who the culprit is.

751
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,047
That's why I said it could be an employee.

752
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:46,965
Then, what if…

753
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,640
the culprit is your employee?

754
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,142
Well then,

755
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,811
I would pay for it.

756
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:00,812
Why?

757
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,192
You want me to die for it?

758
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,120
Hey, cool off.

759
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,498
I was joking. Don't take it seriously.

760
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,467
<i>Oppa, </i>don't go too easy
on that military nut job,

761
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,178
'cause if you don't reign that bastard in,

762
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,056
well, he could come back
to bite you in the end.

763
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,184
Boksoon

764
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,813
is considering not renewing.

765
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,776
Figures.

766
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,321
Women always stop working
once they have a kid.

767
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,199
She's been patient with us.

768
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,789
Hey, by the way, who's the dad?

769
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:03,875
Just

770
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,961
a simple guy.

771
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,881
Someone unlike us, then.

772
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,386
Anyway, don't worry,

773
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,349
'cause Mantis will return soon,
and we're training our newest generation.

774
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,769
Gil Boksoon is due to retire.

775
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,399
Even the best knife
will grow dull over time.

776
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,194
Earlier today,

777
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,281
I offended Boksoon at lunch.

778
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,866
And she…

779
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,953
she said she'd stab me for saying it,

780
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,330
using the dullest knife.

781
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,250
Why the dullest knife?

782
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,212
Because

783
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,590
it would hurt more.

784
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,100
You weren't really trying
to kill that kid.

785
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,104
You weren't trying to kill him.
I know who you are.

786
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,903
But then why did you do it?
You're not that kind of kid.

787
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,529
And what kind of kid is that?

788
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,866
I'm not one of your houseplants.
Leave me alone.

789
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,659
Do you…

790
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,328
You think they just grow on their own?

791
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,915
I trim their branches,
and I pull out all their weeds!

792
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,500
I do all that, okay?

793
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,296
Where are you going?

794
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,964
To photosynthesize.

795
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,948
<i>This is</i>
<i>the final boarding call for flight 237</i>

796
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,075
<i>with service to Hong Kong.</i>

797
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,077
<i>For any passengers on this flight,</i>

798
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,330
<i>please make your way to gate three bravo.</i>

799
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,835
How did things go at the school yesterday?

800
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,588
<i>Don't even ask.</i>

801
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,508
<i>I wish someone</i>
<i>would just shoot me in the head.</i>

802
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,219
<i>And your daughter?</i>

803
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,804
<i>Have you spoken to her?</i>

804
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,141
<i>It's like I'm talking to a wall.</i>

805
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,309
<i>She won't open up to me.</i>

806
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,021
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

807
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,066
<i>I wish being a mom</i>
<i>had a set contract period too.</i>

808
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,780
<i>There's always a reason</i>
<i>as to why someone puts up a wall.</i>

809
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,615
Wait it out,

810
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,035
and she'll come around when she's ready.

811
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,330
It's up to her to start it.

812
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,833
For mothers,

813
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,587
that defies our very nature.

814
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,591
Then I suppose you could give her a dad.

815
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,558
Oh, right, uh,
your work schedule is ready.

816
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,851
Do you need to rehearse?

817
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,437
No, let's get the cameras rolling.

818
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,357
<i>I'll send you the equipment</i>
<i>as well as an intern.</i>

819
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,777
<i>It's their training process,</i>
<i>so give them some real-life experience.</i>

820
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,406
<i>One teenager is enough for me to manage.</i>

821
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,451
<i>You'll like them.</i>

822
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,709
Good evening, miss.

823
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,923
Open it.

824
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,179
Why don't we use sleeping pills.
What's with the box cutter?

825
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,806
Director Cha said
we needed something more provocative.

826
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,766
Mmm…

827
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,394
-The letter?
-Yes.

828
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,648
They analyzed the target's handwriting
and forged it with a ballpoint pen.

829
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,024
Would you like to check, miss?

830
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,109
The work is easier
the less you know about it.

831
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,611
Suicides are easy.

832
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,780
Let's finish quickly and go.

833
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,553
He looks even younger than me.
Why do you think he needs to die?

834
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,806
He looks like a classic pervert.

835
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,268
The type who spike a girl's drink
and then kill her to classical music.

836
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,394
Really?

837
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:33,812
No.

838
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,564
He has the face of a goddamn angel.

839
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,304
Why would he eat this junk?
It's so unhealthy.

840
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,231
He's left-handed.

841
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,192
Okay.

842
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:26,948
Hang on a sec.

843
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,993
You can't cut in one clean motion,

844
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,453
can you?

845
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,747
There would be hesitation wounds,

846
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,082
'cause he would stop and start
while he was cutting.

847
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,500
Got it.

848
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,002
Give me it.

849
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,003
Yes, ma'am.

850
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:48,428
The tip of your blade needs
to carry emotion, like this.

851
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,180
There's 60 percent fear…

852
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,600
…and 40 percent hesitation.

853
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,270
I can feel them,
your emotions, even from here.

854
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:04,069
<i>Senator Oh Jeong-sik,</i>
<i>the new candidate for prime minister,</i>

855
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,820
<i>is currently refuting all claims</i>

856
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,324
<i>that his son was fraudulently</i>
<i>admitted into a college of music.</i>

857
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,744
<i>Meanwhile, the prosecution has</i>
<i>just recently summoned the senator's son</i>

858
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,537
<i>so that they may begin the investigation.</i>

859
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,622
MY FATHER IS INNOCENT

860
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,793
CAN'T STAND THE INJUSTICE

861
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,753
I NO LONGER WANT TO BE A BURDEN

862
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,091
FATHER, PLEASE FORGIVE ME
FOR LEAVING FIRST

863
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,013
Shouldn't your phone be on silent?

864
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,351
It isn't mine.

865
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,775
PWINCESS

866
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,112
Wait outside for a moment.

867
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,906
-I…
-Should I go instead?

868
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,783
Of course not. Right.

869
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,208
I'm working right now.

870
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:03,628
-<i>Will you be home late?</i>
<i>-</i>Why?

871
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,423
<i>Just, you know…</i>

872
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:09,968
<i>Mom?</i>

873
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,762
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

874
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,436
Have you eaten?

875
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,355
<i>Not yet.</i>

876
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,067
Don't skip dinner.

877
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,861
I made kimchi stew earlier.

878
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,876
VLADIVOSTOK

879
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,128
Two shots.

880
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,390
KILL BOKSOON

881
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,650
<i>Can you talk?</i>

882
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,859
Hmm, for a minute.

883
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,654
Is it over?

884
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:54,822
<i>I failed.</i>

885
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,535
What?

886
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,372
He woke up.
Maybe there wasn't enough sleep gas.

887
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,040
I should've checked beforehand.

888
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,668
It was my mistake.

889
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,421
<i>No.</i>
<i>You read the suicide note, didn't you?</i>

890
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,176
You know I don't read those things.

891
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,471
There are three reasons
why I can't believe you.

892
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,515
First,

893
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:24,018
there is no way that Gil Boksoon
could fail this show.

894
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,396
Second,

895
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,065
there is no way that Gil Boksoon
<i>would </i>fail this show.

896
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,358
And third,

897
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,777
<i>the client for this show</i>
<i>is a heartless father</i>

898
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,904
<i>who is trying to kill his own child.</i>

899
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,160
Are you saying that I would choose not to?

900
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,997
<i>You would know better.</i>

901
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,460
"You must always attempt
shows sanctioned by your company."

902
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,213
If you didn't actually fail…

903
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,430
…then you just broke the rules.

904
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,142
So… are you gonna kill me?

905
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,027
<i>Why aren't you answering me?</i>

906
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,198
Hold on.

907
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,581
Cameras are rolling.

908
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,584
His phone should be off. He's on set.

909
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,344
Kill that Asian bastard!

910
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,347
Ah!

911
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,392
Don't back away!
You fucking bastard!

912
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,310
Ah!

913
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,962
<i>Just listen to me while you work.</i>

914
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,299
<i>I've clearly let you know</i>
<i>that I failed this show.</i>

915
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,927
<i>Whether you believe me or not,</i>

916
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,178
<i>that's up to you.</i>

917
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,099
<i>But you better believe me if you need</i>
<i>my signature on that contract.</i>

918
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,820
Cease-fire!

919
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,492
Anything else then?

920
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:48,037
<i>One more thing.</i>

921
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,290
No one else can work on my failed show.

922
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,751
If you agree,

923
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,671
then I'll renew it.

924
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,285
It's not him.

925
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,832
Over there!

926
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,953
Let me speak with the intern.

927
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,209
Do I have to lie about
what happened in there?

928
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,293
No.

929
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,670
Just tell the truth, Young-ji.

930
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,093
Hello, Chairman, uh, can you hear me?

931
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,930
<i>Did she really fail?</i>

932
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,435
I'm afraid I wasn't on set.

933
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,897
-<i>Try that again.</i>
-Uh…

934
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,233
Uh, yes.

935
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,651
She failed tonight.

936
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,362
I think I miscalculated
the amount of gas we needed.

937
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,696
Sorry about that.

938
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,490
<i>Let me speak to Boksoon.</i>

939
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,075
Yeah.

940
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,289
<i>I also have a condition.</i>

941
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,878
I decide the duration.

942
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,173
You'll be with MK until the contract ends.

943
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,426
Gil Boksoon will continue to be our knife.

944
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,166
SO-RA

945
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,628
YOU'RE NOT PICKING UP
CALL ME

946
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,387
How could she? Come on.

947
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,098
I mean, even with her having a kid…

948
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,525
What if

949
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,653
she broke the rules on purpose?

950
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,823
And why would she?

951
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:16,787
Right. So?

952
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,082
I'll reassign the show.
We'll find somebody else.

953
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,417
<i>No.</i>

954
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,252
<i>Just close it as a failed case.</i>

955
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,422
Are you out of your mind?

956
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:29,091
It's a level-A case.
What about our reputation?

957
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,302
Was this all Gil Boksoon's idea?

958
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:35,932
That means yeah.

959
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,935
She didn't want to do it.

960
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,395
<i>The two of you are unbelievable.</i>

961
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,774
Why would you do this for her?
What is it about her?

962
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,317
I have to go.

963
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,319
Have the contract ready.

964
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:51,072
<i>Today we have flight 2P on crew…</i>

965
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,418
Your daughter

966
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,129
fortunately took after her mother.

967
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:09,966
But she looks so depressed.

968
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,511
She'd be prettier if she smiled.

969
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,349
Officer,

970
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:22,061
you should've lived a better life
if you wanted to die a natural death.

971
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,522
It'll be over once I move the chair.

972
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,850
You're supposed to be in school right now.

973
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,312
Is my dad going to die?

974
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,067
Your dad is killing himself

975
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,861
after he killed

976
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,946
his own daughter.

977
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,700
Ah.

978
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,952
I should've stayed for the last class.

979
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,500
How chaotic.

980
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,378
These have rules,

981
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,797
If you had followed them,
you could've been done.

982
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,969
There's no point
if you're going to mix it up again.

983
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,182
How old are you, huh?

984
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,560
Seventeen.

985
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,438
-That complicates things.
-Why?

986
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:51,317
I have a younger sister, so I have a rule.

987
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,110
Kids are off limits.

988
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,823
So it's not only bad people
in this line of work.

989
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,832
Are you always this brave then?

990
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,043
Defining a kid,

991
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,421
that can actually be really unclear.

992
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,256
A rule should be definite.

993
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,342
How about under 18?

994
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,802
I don't have a license yet.

995
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,555
But letting a witness live is…

996
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:22,723
Hey!

997
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,356
Now you're the witness here.

998
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:07,476
Director Cha,
has today been a little challenging?

999
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:14,567
You know, it's polite not to ask me
if it's clear I'm having a shitty day.

1000
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,612
So did you find anything?

1001
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,281
Ah, yes.

1002
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,700
In the Daejeon research murder case,
actually.

1003
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,036
That Toyota truck,
the one that disappeared.

1004
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,913
We found it at a junkyard.

1005
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,748
And the dash cam was still intact.

1006
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,459
We were able to identify everyone there.

1007
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,255
Ah, shit.

1008
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,631
Is that someone you know?

1009
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:52,021
Detective Kang,
you see these people in the police force?

1010
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,903
<i>The ones who are talented,</i>
<i>but can't seem to make it big.</i>

1011
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,237
<i>What could be the reason?</i>

1012
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,865
<i>Maybe they have an attitude problem.</i>

1013
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,117
<i>Or maybe they fell out of favor</i>
<i>with their bosses.</i>

1014
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,661
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>Just left out in the cold.</i>

1015
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,080
<i>And they don't even know why.</i>

1016
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,333
<i>Poor thing.</i>

1017
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,133
Why so surprised?

1018
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,719
It's like you're guilty of a crime.

1019
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,223
<i>I am innocent on all accounts!</i>

1020
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:31,101
<i>All of these people</i>
<i>who are trying to slander me</i>

1021
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,103
<i>are now also attacking my son.</i>

1022
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:37,733
<i>I, Oh Jeong-sik,</i>
<i>will march forward without hesitation</i>

1023
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,819
<i>and will take action</i>
<i>against these lowbrow attacks.</i>

1024
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,616
Oh Jeong-sik!
Oh Jeong-sik!

1025
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,496
I wasn't actually trying to kill him.

1026
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,623
I'm not a psychopath, okay?

1027
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:57,419
I'm done.

1028
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,089
No. Hey.

1029
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:02,591
Here. Go ahead.

1030
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:06,720
So?

1031
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:11,892
Cheol-woo wouldn't leave me alone.

1032
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,145
I wasn't trying to stab him.

1033
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,814
I… I just wanted to scare--

1034
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:17,773
That's right.

1035
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,692
That's right. I knew it.

1036
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,154
Yoo Cheol-woo is…

1037
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:26,573
He just pretends

1038
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:27,616
that he's brave.

1039
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,868
You know, his mother
is the exact same way.

1040
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:33,038
Can you not interrupt this time?

1041
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,457
Oh. You go ahead.

1042
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,750
That day…

1043
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,380
he sent a bunch of pictures
to me at lunch.

1044
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,937
<i>I'm really sorry to interrupt.</i>

1045
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,481
What was in these pictures?

1046
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,067
They're just

1047
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,570
of me, taken secretly.

1048
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,198
So I said they had to be deleted.

1049
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,534
Under one condition.

1050
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,703
You can't take my photo
without my consent.

1051
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:13,704
-Oh!
-Delete them!

1052
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,457
Then date me for a month.

1053
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,083
What?

1054
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,879
Hey, were you dropped
on your head or something, huh?

1055
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:23,630
One month.

1056
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:24,715
And after that,

1057
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,842
I'll go ahead and break your heart,

1058
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,011
'cause I'll get to end it.

1059
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,182
What's the point in dating then?

1060
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,018
There is no fucking point.

1061
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,479
What matters is
how everyone else sees me after.

1062
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,189
Wow.

1063
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,608
You really are a pussy, then.

1064
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,195
Hey.

1065
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,490
Shit, for fuck's sake!

1066
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:52,743
You made me this way, okay?

1067
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:54,119
You got that?

1068
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,960
So are you in?

1069
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,089
The second I press send on this message,

1070
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,883
half our school gets these pictures.

1071
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:09,593
If you do…

1072
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:13,514
I'm gonna kill you.

1073
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:16,642
Oh, I'm so scared.

1074
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,894
Hurry or I'm gonna press it.

1075
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,398
Five.

1076
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:24,650
Four.

1077
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:26,777
Three.

1078
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:28,946
Two.

1079
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,115
One.

1080
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,282
Wait!

1081
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,034
Wait! Cheol-woo!

1082
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:35,828
Please don't.

1083
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,038
Please? My life will be over.

1084
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,290
You don't want me to?

1085
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,668
Then go talk to Jae-young.

1086
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:46,880
Asshole.

1087
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,217
Jae-young,

1088
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,346
let's just do what he says, okay?
It wouldn't cost us anything, right?

1089
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,683
-It's not like you're losing anything.
-Jae-young, please.

1090
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,059
Look, she's begging you.

1091
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:00,936
This wasn't anything.

1092
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,064
Hey, also,

1093
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,233
who's the man in this relationship here?

1094
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,696
Jae-young, stop!

1095
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,157
Cheol-woo, are you okay?

1096
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:15,951
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1097
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,049
It's So-ra and I.

1098
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:34,845
I know.

1099
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,605
I don't like boys, Mom.

1100
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,488
Why do you look like that?

1101
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:57,826
Like what?

1102
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:13,967
But, Jae-young,

1103
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,555
what if you're confused?

1104
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,062
You could've told me about this, you know?

1105
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,940
And if I liked boys instead,

1106
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,735
would I have to come tell you that?

1107
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,529
That I was into guys?

1108
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,031
I just…

1109
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:38,742
No, you wouldn't, but…

1110
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,955
But how can you not tell me anything?

1111
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,918
Yeah, how about you?

1112
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,212
Are you ever honest?

1113
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,516
Do you want to die?

1114
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,601
You're at my house.

1115
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:05,978
Just do it.

1116
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,896
Director Cha fired me.

1117
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,440
I didn't even get to make my debut.

1118
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,401
It all makes sense

1119
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:15,028
since a little intern dared

1120
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,406
to mess up the great Gil Boksoon's show.

1121
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,618
I might not be worth
a speck of dust to you, but…

1122
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:26,331
do you know how much I went
through to get where I was?

1123
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:32,671
Fine.

1124
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:34,715
You're just in time.

1125
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,346
It's always at the worst time
that something happens at work

1126
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,265
and they even send someone to get you.

1127
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,771
Uh, Jae-young, listen.

1128
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,316
We'll talk more when I get back.

1129
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,164
Hmm.

1130
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:10,375
So then,

1131
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,669
are you here to fight or…

1132
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,088
I did nothing wrong in that show.

1133
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,302
If there was something,
it would be that I lied for you.

1134
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:21,595
All right.

1135
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:25,724
Look, sometimes in this life,

1136
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,352
things become your fault for no reason,

1137
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,812
and other times,
you get away with things you did.

1138
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,857
That doesn't happen.

1139
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,150
For example,

1140
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,488
let's say that you like girls.

1141
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,784
-You're not doing anything wrong.
-Right.

1142
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:46,328
But to others, it could seem like you are.

1143
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:50,874
Isn't that a little conservative
for a hired assassin?

1144
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:54,961
Adults are all like that.
You think your parents are different?

1145
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:56,713
Mine aren't alive.

1146
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,343
It's up to us

1147
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,428
to know if we've done wrong.

1148
01:18:04,262 --> 01:18:05,681
Nobody else can decide that.

1149
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,104
You kids these days…

1150
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:15,565
are so wise.

1151
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,279
PWINCESS

1152
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,450
Hmm.

1153
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:27,285
Take care.

1154
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:32,916
Only two tables today.

1155
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:34,751
Hello, sir.

1156
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,713
-Who is this?
-Our company's intern.

1157
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,966
Wow, an intern at MK?

1158
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,175
That's great.

1159
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,218
When's your debut?

1160
01:18:43,301 --> 01:18:44,553
They fired me.

1161
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,346
All right, that's enough.

1162
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,890
You're not getting fired, okay?

1163
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,102
I sparred with her.
She's ruthless. She'll be big.

1164
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:54,104
Whoa.

1165
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:58,191
And if that's coming
from Gil Boksoon, bravo.

1166
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,110
-We'll eat this. I'm starving.
-Oh?

1167
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:02,529
-Let's go.
-That's what I'm saying.

1168
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,948
-Oh, hello, Boksoon.
-Oh, Boksoon, hello.

1169
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:07,659
I mean, you even have a new suit.

1170
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,078
You're here early.

1171
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:14,207
Hello, my name is Kim Young-ji,
a trainee at MK from the 12th class.

1172
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,209
Oh, MK.

1173
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,129
Oh, MK. How you doing?

1174
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:20,088
Uh…

1175
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,340
You've come to celebrate with us, huh?

1176
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,467
Come on. See?

1177
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,261
I told you that people
at big companies are more loyal.

1178
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:27,804
Congratulate?

1179
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,848
Hee-sung,
isn't that why you're here right now?

1180
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:34,811
You didn't hear about it?
He was promoted to rank A today.

1181
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:36,855
That was fast.

1182
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,317
Oh. Well, yeah, it happened today, so…

1183
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,247
How did they do it?

1184
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,877
Sorry I couldn't tell you in advance,
<i>Oppa. </i>You understand, right?

1185
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,504
It's what was best for the company.

1186
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,465
That wasn't your decision to make.

1187
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,091
I'm the director, aren't I?

1188
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,094
Why is she so special?

1189
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,473
Come on, you can brag.

1190
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:13,225
Your show was breaking news.

1191
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,434
Yeah.

1192
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:19,022
Boksoon, you should take a look
and tell him he did well, huh?

1193
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,649
<i>Today at 4:30 p.m.,</i>

1194
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:24,152
<i>the son of prime minister candidate</i>
<i>Oh Jeong-sik died</i>

1195
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,655
<i>after falling</i>
<i>from the roof of his apartment.</i>

1196
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:28,698
<i>Oh had already stopped breathing</i>

1197
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:31,493
<i>by the time ambulances</i>
<i>arrived on the scene.</i>

1198
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,447
What?

1199
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,285
Why are you staring at me?

1200
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,373
You must think that I'm insane now, right?

1201
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,918
At least I'm honest with myself.

1202
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,301
Are you, though?

1203
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:34,014
If you want it, it's best
you just take it yourself, isn't it?

1204
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:38,518
But you won't, right?

1205
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:40,812
I have,

1206
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,231
and it's our knife.

1207
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,153
Finish preparing the rest of the plans.

1208
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,447
You know, I gave up on that show.

1209
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:54,117
What are you talking about?
You gave up on a sanctioned show?

1210
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,285
Uh, no, she failed.

1211
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,328
She meant she failed.

1212
01:21:56,411 --> 01:21:58,455
She failed it? Boksoon failed a show?

1213
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,623
Who was it?

1214
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:02,542
Do I have to answer that?

1215
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,295
Oh my goodness. The soup must be ready.

1216
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,214
Why were you suddenly given an A?

1217
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:10,800
Why?

1218
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,012
Did you think
I'd never make it to A level?

1219
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:14,971
No.

1220
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,642
That's just perfect, huh?

1221
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:22,979
So it was you blocking me
all these years, huh?

1222
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,718
What took you so long to pick up?

1223
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:56,930
<i>Director Cha.</i>

1224
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:01,810
Oh boy.

1225
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:03,603
<i>Unni?</i>

1226
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,605
I see you've taken
an interesting approach.

1227
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,815
<i>Oh, </i>Unni.

1228
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,359
<i>I have more power than you think.</i>

1229
01:23:10,443 --> 01:23:12,112
You'll get in trouble for this.

1230
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,905
<i>Oppa </i>can't do anything.

1231
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:16,241
No.

1232
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:17,867
But I can.

1233
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,915
But I didn't call you.
I called Hee-sung, didn't I?

1234
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,583
Fine.

1235
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,002
You'll see me eventually.

1236
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:32,257
You'd better just take it here.

1237
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:39,889
Director.

1238
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,601
Uh, no, um…

1239
01:23:46,646 --> 01:23:48,064
Uh, Boksoon's with me.

1240
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,068
And there's some friends from
other companies and one of our interns.

1241
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:55,280
Uh, it's just that…

1242
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:59,159
That, um,
would be a little difficult, yes.

1243
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,292
I understand.

1244
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,467
Director Cha asked if she could say hello.

1245
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:17,177
To us?

1246
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,888
<i>Hello, this Cha Min-hee of MK.</i>

1247
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,766
<i>Are you not going to say hi back?</i>

1248
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,809
-Ah, yes, hello, Miss Cha.
-Hello, Miss Cha.

1249
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,812
-<i>Young-ji, you there too?</i>
<i>-</i>Uh, yeah.

1250
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,273
<i>I've heard a lot</i>
<i>about all of you from Hee-sung.</i>

1251
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,026
<i>He said that each of you</i>
<i>has great potential.</i>

1252
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:37,697
<i>That's why I want to give everyone</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

1253
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,783
<i>to become an employee of MK,</i>

1254
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,743
<i>starting at at least a B rank.</i>

1255
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:44,913
<i>Young-ji,</i>
<i>you'd make your debut right away.</i>

1256
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:47,207
-Stop messing with them, all right?
-Excuse me.

1257
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,501
Does that mean the unemployed also?

1258
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,919
<i>Yes.</i>

1259
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,713
<i>You'll have to take on a show</i>
<i>with Hee-sung.</i>

1260
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,926
<i>One of our employees disgraced us</i>
<i>by breaking the rules.</i>

1261
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:01,137
<i>I hereby authorize this</i>
<i>as the director of MK.</i>

1262
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,555
<i>That employee will have--</i>

1263
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,183
Let go of it.

1264
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,652
Aren't you all ashamed?

1265
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,363
The last time here, you said that MK--

1266
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:25,995
Ah!

1267
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,581
Yah!

1268
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:30,667
Ah, shit.

1269
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:57,986
Ah!

1270
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,072
PWINCESS

1271
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:16,296
Ah!

1272
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,974
Ah!

1273
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,690
Ah!

1274
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,363
Come on! Get her!

1275
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,700
Boksoon, please!

1276
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,541
Ah, shit.

1277
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,584
Get down!

1278
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:57,879
Oh.

1279
01:26:58,713 --> 01:26:59,797
Is it painful?

1280
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,468
No hitting my face.

1281
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,849
Okay.

1282
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,142
Hi-yah! Ow!

1283
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:14,979
Whoa.

1284
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,567
You have all my respect, Boksoon.

1285
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,416
This is some contradiction, isn't it?

1286
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:37,877
You've been enjoying this too.

1287
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:42,382
I hope you understand, Boksoon,
that it's…

1288
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,843
just how life goes.

1289
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,387
Yeah, sure.

1290
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,682
Everyone for themself.

1291
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,695
You're going places, kid.

1292
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:14,706
Ah!

1293
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,340
Ah!

1294
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:39,647
Ah!

1295
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,406
Ah!

1296
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,248
Ah!

1297
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:21,499
Nice debut.

1298
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:32,343
I did some unsanctioned shows.

1299
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:36,264
But then the director
found out about them.

1300
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:43,855
You know that I really liked you?

1301
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:51,821
That's lame, Hee-sung.

1302
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:54,824
So that didn't help.

1303
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,915
Promise…

1304
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,502
Promise me that you'll check on my dad.

1305
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,330
PWINCESS

1306
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,252
This is Gil Boksoon.

1307
01:31:49,795 --> 01:31:52,465
I need you to clean this place up.
I'll explain later.

1308
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:00,848
-We're in trouble right?
-No.

1309
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:04,519
We're fucked.

1310
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,567
Well, I guess it's comforting to know that

1311
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,778
we're fucked together.

1312
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:19,534
Why help me?

1313
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,332
Just… to survive.

1314
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:31,754
It looked like you had
the best shot out of everybody there.

1315
01:32:46,852 --> 01:32:50,815
I'm sorry I couldn't answer
your calls, but, uh, I'll be home late.

1316
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:56,070
Are you all right?

1317
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:58,948
<i>Are you crying because of me?</i>

1318
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,579
Jae-young, please don't cry.

1319
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:06,289
What happened?

1320
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,374
<i>Mom, hello?</i>

1321
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:10,960
<i>Hello?</i>

1322
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,380
You've gone too far this time.

1323
01:33:15,047 --> 01:33:18,676
-I'm done. I can't keep letting it slide.
-<i>Mom, what's wrong?</i>

1324
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:20,261
Hang up the…

1325
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:21,721
<i>Mom, are you there?</i>

1326
01:33:22,722 --> 01:33:23,889
Hang up my phone.

1327
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:25,766
<i>Mom!</i>

1328
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:30,229
Mom, what is it?

1329
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:33,024
Are you there?

1330
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:34,567
<i>Mom.</i>

1331
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:39,530
Sir, wait!

1332
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:41,699
She did nothing wrong. Please, sir!

1333
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:43,409
It was Director Cha's orders.

1334
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,579
It's all because Director Cha
told them to kill her.

1335
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:47,955
That's what caused it!

1336
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,602
Cleaners are required
to report employees' bodies

1337
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:11,812
to their respective companies.

1338
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,483
I need to go home for the night.

1339
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,401
All companies

1340
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:19,487
will get notice by sunrise.

1341
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:22,823
Tell your sister she can expect a visit.

1342
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,078
You won't touch her.

1343
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,914
-She's handling your contract.
-Are you serious?

1344
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,999
I can only protect you now

1345
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:34,669
if you stay with us.

1346
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:37,838
Well, isn't that touching?

1347
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,174
The other companies' pride is on the line.

1348
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:43,302
Their employees died
and they don't know the reason why.

1349
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:44,845
Get it?

1350
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:47,556
They won't give up until you're dead.

1351
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:52,520
I could just explain myself.

1352
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:56,315
But how would you protect your sister?

1353
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,736
That would mean
I'd have to kill you right here.

1354
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,283
It would break my heart

1355
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,495
to leave your child as an orphan.

1356
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:43,946
I'll see you at the office.

1357
01:35:45,197 --> 01:35:46,782
I'll get the contract together.

1358
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,002
Now aren't you the one

1359
01:35:58,961 --> 01:36:00,087
that's building a wall?

1360
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,346
She wasn't doing anything wrong.

1361
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,766
She's too good for us to lose.

1362
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,607
Thank you for the lesson, ma'am!

1363
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,435
You just disappeared!

1364
01:36:57,269 --> 01:36:58,145
What happened?

1365
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:59,480
Why did you hang up?

1366
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:01,690
Do you even know how worried I got?

1367
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:04,443
Uh…

1368
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:06,987
Uh, my phone fell.

1369
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,739
What is it?

1370
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,205
Nothing happened.

1371
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:18,999
I'm fine, okay?

1372
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:21,502
Huh?

1373
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,879
Nothing happened to me either.

1374
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,509
Gil Jae-young.

1375
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:36,141
So-ra and I are done.

1376
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:38,060
Why?

1377
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:41,689
Because you know about So-ra and I,
she told me to never talk to her again.

1378
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:44,608
She said she was never into it.

1379
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:46,861
It was all a joke.

1380
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:50,531
All of it.

1381
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:02,167
She says she's not like that.

1382
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:11,260
Are you like that then?

1383
01:38:11,343 --> 01:38:13,429
Yes, I am like that.

1384
01:38:15,014 --> 01:38:16,432
And that's why you ran away.

1385
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:22,771
I'm really sorry.

1386
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:25,149
Sorry about what exactly?

1387
01:38:27,693 --> 01:38:29,069
Now I have my answer.

1388
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:33,657
So I'll just make sure
to hide it from everyone.

1389
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,743
Why can't you just accept my apology?

1390
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:38,913
Do you only feel better
by making me look stupid?

1391
01:38:45,794 --> 01:38:46,629
And

1392
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:51,175
stop saying there's something wrong.
You don't have to hide who you are.

1393
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:17,201
Something happened, didn't it?

1394
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,294
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want.

1395
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,485
I have this group of colleagues.

1396
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:57,241
They were all a little mean to me today.

1397
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,746
So we got into a fight.

1398
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:05,708
Why?

1399
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,796
It happens sometimes on any job.

1400
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,967
We're all trying to survive.

1401
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:19,888
And…

1402
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,560
you think So-ra really meant that?

1403
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:27,104
Come on.

1404
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:31,650
She's also trying to survive.

1405
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:37,114
So what will you do now?

1406
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,119
It's over.

1407
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,372
I won't see them again.

1408
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,128
You're fine.

1409
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,717
And I can't let go yet.

1410
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,888
I must've been really in love with her.

1411
01:41:03,932 --> 01:41:05,726
If I knew this was how it'd end,

1412
01:41:05,809 --> 01:41:09,605
then I should've just dated
that lame kid Cheol-woo.

1413
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,400
Then I'd still be with So-ra right now.

1414
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:18,197
I'd be at that school you wanted.

1415
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:21,617
Okay.

1416
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,578
So why didn't you then?

1417
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:31,418
I just wanted to be true to myself.

1418
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:48,102
You're amazing,

1419
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:49,770
sweetheart.

1420
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:56,944
Mom?

1421
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,987
Hmm?

1422
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:01,698
I looked in your bag once, and

1423
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:03,659
I saw a gun.

1424
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,621
A fake passport too.

1425
01:42:14,878 --> 01:42:16,463
The company you work for…

1426
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:26,473
It's the CIA, right?

1427
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:33,856
'Cause I looked it up online,
and that made a lot of sense.

1428
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,158
Jae-young,

1429
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:47,995
I'm not saying anything.

1430
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:53,208
I knew it.

1431
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,128
Top secret.

1432
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:01,300
That must get pretty hard, huh?

1433
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:05,721
Makes two of us.

1434
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:09,308
I'd better change.

1435
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:10,309
Mm-hmm.

1436
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:25,574
Mom.

1437
01:43:26,658 --> 01:43:28,994
Have you ever fired that gun?

1438
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:31,705
Yeah.

1439
01:43:31,788 --> 01:43:33,582
But just when I'm practicing.

1440
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:52,559
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if she's Gil Boksoon or Kill Boksoon,</i>

1441
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,144
<i>I can't let just let her go unpunished,</i>

1442
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:58,315
'cause I've poured
everything that I have straight into this.

1443
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:00,400
There's no respect in this.

1444
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:03,362
He's right.

1445
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:06,240
If an elite agent like Gil Boksoon
made that kind of move,

1446
01:44:06,323 --> 01:44:08,367
couldn't MK have other intentions?

1447
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,576
The cleaners said

1448
01:44:10,285 --> 01:44:11,828
they were having drinks.

1449
01:44:12,829 --> 01:44:15,207
It must've been her personal decision.

1450
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,460
<i>Personal </i>decision.

1451
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:22,005
But, I mean,
they won't fire her, will they?

1452
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,715
She's Chairman Cha's favorite knife.

1453
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:24,675
So…

1454
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:29,513
did she really…

1455
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:33,183
decide on her own?

1456
01:44:36,895 --> 01:44:39,398
Oh no! <i>Unni, </i>sorry!

1457
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:44,528
I thought that you'd be dead,
so I deactivated your card.

1458
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,114
Americano, no sugar, wasn't it?

1459
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:49,157
Don't smile.

1460
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,744
It shows your fangs.

1461
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,496
Well, be careful.

1462
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,331
My bite stings.

1463
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:57,249
Huh.

1464
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,835
It did sting a little.

1465
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:07,009
No matter how much
of an unprecedented, raving bitch she is,

1466
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,304
I find it hard to believe

1467
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:12,848
she killed them all just like that.

1468
01:45:14,224 --> 01:45:15,559
Are you convinced by that?

1469
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:17,728
I'm not, and that's the issue.

1470
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:21,023
But then why would Gil Boksoon do that?

1471
01:45:22,107 --> 01:45:23,066
That's right.

1472
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,609
Let's hear it from Cha.

1473
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:27,362
If she really decided,

1474
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:30,157
then he'll give Boksoon over to us.

1475
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:36,747
But if excuses are made,

1476
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,124
Chairman Cha

1477
01:45:39,958 --> 01:45:42,669
<i>could </i>have been involved in it.

1478
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,421
Ah, come on.

1479
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:46,506
By the way, gentlemen,

1480
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:49,343
can you bring it up to Cha

1481
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:50,635
once you're face-to-face?

1482
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,804
We must! He's the one who made the rules

1483
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:55,015
we operate by
in the first place, isn't he?

1484
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:58,727
Ah! And he made us kill our own.
That's right.

1485
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:01,146
Every time a lousy rule was violated.

1486
01:46:01,229 --> 01:46:03,774
I won't let things slide this time.

1487
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,779
You're early this morning.

1488
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:16,661
That's what I expected.

1489
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,626
Is Director Cha not here today?

1490
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:24,920
She had to see to a few things.

1491
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:29,091
Let's start.

1492
01:46:29,174 --> 01:46:32,135
Min-kyu will be
well into damage control right now.

1493
01:46:33,303 --> 01:46:34,513
It's pretty remarkable.

1494
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,892
How is it that you exist
in a world beyond his rules?

1495
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:43,897
What's so special about Boksoon?

1496
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,899
He needs to resolve this,

1497
01:46:45,982 --> 01:46:48,485
in order to keep
his sister's neck off the line.

1498
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:51,696
That so?

1499
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:57,327
That's why we're signing this contract.

1500
01:46:58,203 --> 01:47:00,414
A mutual agreement to share the same fate.

1501
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,125
Don't worry.

1502
01:47:04,793 --> 01:47:07,629
You and I aren't going
to get all chummy now.

1503
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,175
I think I can go on as is,

1504
01:47:12,801 --> 01:47:14,636
pretending not to despise you.

1505
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:18,807
Still, I'm curious what he'll say…

1506
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:23,478
since we both share that fate,

1507
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:28,150
The lead in the latest unsanctioned show
was unfortunately one of my own employees.

1508
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:30,152
Han Hee-sung, it appears.

1509
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:33,530
First, I would like to apologize
to you all here.

1510
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:35,866
This matter was assigned

1511
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:39,119
to another of our MK employees.

1512
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:44,374
Gil Boksoon was given it so we could
handle it efficiently and internally.

1513
01:47:45,083 --> 01:47:46,042
Last night,

1514
01:47:46,918 --> 01:47:48,503
as Gil was dealing with Han,

1515
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:51,006
Han ended up resisting.

1516
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:52,757
And while aiding in his defense,

1517
01:47:53,842 --> 01:47:56,344
the employees that you had,
that were close to Han Hee-sung--

1518
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:57,679
Wait, wait, wait.

1519
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:00,891
So let me get this straight.

1520
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:05,312
You're saying that…

1521
01:48:05,395 --> 01:48:08,773
the violation last night was
because of our employees?

1522
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:09,816
Not at all.

1523
01:48:11,401 --> 01:48:13,487
They were just trying to help Hee-sung,

1524
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:14,779
to save their friend.

1525
01:48:16,114 --> 01:48:18,575
As a result, MK would like to give you all

1526
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:20,619
sufficient compensation for it.

1527
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,955
So just how much compensation
do you mean?

1528
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:26,041
Is that what really matters?

1529
01:48:26,124 --> 01:48:28,793
We haven't even gotten to the facts yet
and you're just moving ahead.

1530
01:48:28,877 --> 01:48:30,295
All right. All right.

1531
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:33,590
So…

1532
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:35,175
how about we bring

1533
01:48:35,258 --> 01:48:38,428
Gil Boksoon in and then hear her side?

1534
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:40,472
Yes, indeed, she's just, uh,

1535
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:42,349
in treatment for her injuries.

1536
01:48:42,432 --> 01:48:44,184
What about that kid?

1537
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:46,102
The cleaners said

1538
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:48,772
there was a girl
hanging around Gil Boksoon last night.

1539
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:51,691
She was an MK intern, right?

1540
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:54,694
Let's ask her what happened.

1541
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,906
You must keep everything
that happened tonight a secret.

1542
01:48:57,989 --> 01:49:00,575
-Okay.
-I know you'll do a good job, like before.

1543
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:01,660
Like when

1544
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:04,079
you lied to me about the show.

1545
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:07,249
Uh, yes, sir. I'm sorry about that.

1546
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,584
You shouldn't be saying sorry.

1547
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,797
You must just keep on lying,

1548
01:49:14,839 --> 01:49:17,342
even when others know about the truth.

1549
01:49:19,886 --> 01:49:20,720
Uh…

1550
01:49:21,346 --> 01:49:23,932
N-- No! 'Cause I can do a good job, sir!

1551
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:25,559
No, I'm a great liar! Just please, wait.

1552
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:27,477
'Cause I promise, that I'm--

1553
01:49:33,275 --> 01:49:37,195
The easiest way
to solve a problem is to get rid of it.

1554
01:49:37,779 --> 01:49:39,155
You agree, yeah?

1555
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,157
<i>How does that make any sense?</i>

1556
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:44,119
The only witness to their deaths
just suddenly vanished?

1557
01:49:44,202 --> 01:49:46,079
<i>That stupid girl.</i>

1558
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:48,456
I had high hopes, you know?

1559
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:51,084
But there was no other option,

1560
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:54,796
'cause we have so much to protect.

1561
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:58,341
Honestly,

1562
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,636
we've all been thinking the same thing.

1563
01:50:02,679 --> 01:50:04,055
Something isn't right.

1564
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:05,890
Something like…

1565
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,311
like Gil Boson didn't act alone.

1566
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:13,106
That maybe our dear colleague
Chairman Cha

1567
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:15,817
is breaking the rules along with her,

1568
01:50:16,401 --> 01:50:17,485
'cause that's

1569
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:19,946
the conclusion that we've made.

1570
01:50:22,157 --> 01:50:23,783
Oh, and, uh…

1571
01:50:26,578 --> 01:50:28,163
that unsanctioned show,

1572
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:30,749
what's your plan?

1573
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:33,710
You said you'd pay…

1574
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:37,672
…for the mistake.

1575
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:40,842
Will you?

1576
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:45,263
Will you stick to your word in the end?

1577
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:49,059
I wonder what he'll decide!

1578
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:52,562
I think

1579
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:55,065
you've all misunderstood this.

1580
01:50:58,109 --> 01:50:58,943
I

1581
01:51:00,528 --> 01:51:02,447
cannot be a rule breaker.

1582
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,121
And that's because

1583
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:13,083
I am the rule.

1584
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:16,670
-Oh!
-Ay!

1585
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,467
Ah!

1586
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:36,314
First rule,

1587
01:51:37,023 --> 01:51:39,109
you are never to kill anyone underage!

1588
01:51:40,318 --> 01:51:41,236
Second,

1589
01:51:41,778 --> 01:51:44,030
you will only take
shows from your company!

1590
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:45,573
Third,

1591
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:49,119
you must attempt shows
sanctioned by your company!

1592
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:53,206
And fourth,

1593
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,625
you don't ever draw

1594
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,420
weapons during a sacred meeting.

1595
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:04,843
Well, that's it.

1596
01:52:06,511 --> 01:52:08,263
That's our new rule now.

1597
01:52:19,607 --> 01:52:21,317
Does anybody else in here

1598
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:23,486
have their own conclusion?

1599
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:29,325
Who wants to come for my neck now?
Come on!

1600
01:52:30,493 --> 01:52:31,453
Nobody?

1601
01:52:33,955 --> 01:52:35,665
If you decide to come after me,

1602
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:38,918
then send me a knife with blood on it,

1603
01:52:41,379 --> 01:52:43,298
'cause I'll be glad to respond.

1604
01:52:46,301 --> 01:52:48,261
The chairman should get this.

1605
01:52:48,344 --> 01:52:49,804
He can set the location.

1606
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:02,692
<i>This really is an unjust death.</i>

1607
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:06,321
<i>My son had just turned 20.</i>

1608
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:09,699
<i>And he was so honest and talented.</i>

1609
01:53:11,117 --> 01:53:13,495
<i>This was not just a suicide.</i>

1610
01:53:14,037 --> 01:53:16,706
<i>This was a murder</i>
<i>committed by twisted adults</i>

1611
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,708
<i>blinded by political disputes.</i>

1612
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:20,335
Hello?

1613
01:53:21,085 --> 01:53:23,254
<i>To my son, who is watching over…</i>

1614
01:53:23,338 --> 01:53:24,297
Are you there?

1615
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:29,385
<i>Hello?</i>

1616
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:32,263
Ah.

1617
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:34,057
You must be Jae-young.

1618
01:53:35,141 --> 01:53:37,477
I've heard a lot about you
from your mother.

1619
01:53:38,853 --> 01:53:39,687
Who is this?

1620
01:53:41,022 --> 01:53:43,149
Your mother's close colleague. That's all.

1621
01:53:43,775 --> 01:53:44,692
<i>Oh.</i>

1622
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:47,070
<i>From the event-planning company?</i>

1623
01:53:49,531 --> 01:53:50,406
Yeah.

1624
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,952
<i>I guess you called here</i>
<i>since her cell phone broke.</i>

1625
01:53:54,035 --> 01:53:55,203
<i>But she's not home yet.</i>

1626
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:00,750
I see. Thanks.

1627
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:02,919
<i>Uh, sir?</i>

1628
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,091
Can I please ask you something?

1629
01:54:11,469 --> 01:54:12,554
What's she like

1630
01:54:14,097 --> 01:54:15,598
when she's at work?

1631
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:24,357
Your mother's great at what she does.

1632
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,026
And she loves her work a lot.

1633
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:30,196
Is there anything else?

1634
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:34,367
<i>What should I tell</i>
<i>her when she comes home?</i>

1635
01:54:42,667 --> 01:54:43,585
<i>Hello?</i>

1636
01:54:47,463 --> 01:54:49,090
That I got her message.

1637
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:54,262
<i>And that I'll see her</i>
<i>at the office later tonight.</i>

1638
01:54:58,641 --> 01:55:01,519
<i>So Gil Boksoon is the one</i>
<i>who killed Director Cha?</i>

1639
01:55:02,645 --> 01:55:04,731
<i>What the hell is even happening?</i>

1640
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:09,277
<i>Listen,</i>
<i>I heard this from an insider at MK.</i>

1641
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:11,070
<i>But apparently,</i>

1642
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:13,948
<i>Gil even sent Chairman Cha a bloody knife.</i>

1643
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,413
Here. Have a little more.

1644
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:23,207
Hmm.

1645
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:26,836
You have to try everything at your age.

1646
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:39,557
Hey, Mom.

1647
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:43,353
I think I'll stay at my school
and just tell them what happened.

1648
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:46,981
It'd make you happy too, right?

1649
01:55:47,565 --> 01:55:48,858
Are you sure, though?

1650
01:55:56,658 --> 01:55:58,660
I really don't like spinach either.

1651
01:55:58,743 --> 01:55:59,619
It's gross.

1652
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:06,584
Will you be out late?

1653
01:56:09,379 --> 01:56:11,464
I'll probably find out when I get there.

1654
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,217
You know what?

1655
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:17,553
Junk food tastes better.

1656
01:58:59,507 --> 01:59:00,758
He's waiting for you upstairs.

1657
01:59:02,218 --> 01:59:03,511
Aren't you clocked out?

1658
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:05,721
Uh…

1659
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:08,349
You're curious to see who'll make it.

1660
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:14,647
I'll be down.

1661
02:00:08,117 --> 02:00:09,202
Anything to drink?

1662
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:14,707
I drove here.

1663
02:00:18,294 --> 02:00:19,503
My sister died,

1664
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:22,506
but I couldn't shed a single tear.

1665
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,345
I guess I've worked here too long.

1666
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:29,639
You were always like that.

1667
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:32,808
And you?

1668
02:00:35,686 --> 02:00:36,604
I was.

1669
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:40,066
I had actually believed
that you'd changed.

1670
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:42,443
You haven't really.

1671
02:00:47,448 --> 02:00:48,282
Look.

1672
02:00:49,283 --> 02:00:50,701
You're here sitting in front of me.

1673
02:00:51,786 --> 02:00:52,662
You're right.

1674
02:00:54,288 --> 02:00:55,957
We haven't changed a bit.

1675
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:58,584
Not since you're sitting across from me.

1676
02:01:00,169 --> 02:01:01,629
Is this cause of Young-ji?

1677
02:01:01,712 --> 02:01:04,006
She did everything she was supposed to.

1678
02:01:04,924 --> 02:01:06,509
I believe I told you that.

1679
02:01:08,386 --> 02:01:10,221
I had to make sure
your mistakes disappeared.

1680
02:01:10,304 --> 02:01:12,682
But you can't erase them, Min-kyu.

1681
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:14,350
If no one knows about it,

1682
02:01:15,810 --> 02:01:17,228
then it didn't happen.

1683
02:01:17,311 --> 02:01:18,396
But I know.

1684
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:22,858
I have to be true to myself.

1685
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:30,908
You never use two hands.

1686
02:01:31,909 --> 02:01:33,494
So your right hand…

1687
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:54,176
What?

1688
02:03:55,302 --> 02:03:56,512
Can't see my next move?

1689
02:03:59,348 --> 02:04:01,517
Regardless
of which of my hands was injured,

1690
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:03,811
I won't let it become my weakness.

1691
02:04:07,231 --> 02:04:09,233
I already know what your weakness is.

1692
02:04:10,484 --> 02:04:11,318
Hmm.

1693
02:04:11,944 --> 02:04:12,778
What is it?

1694
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:15,865
Me.

1695
02:04:16,991 --> 02:04:17,992
Gil Boksoon.

1696
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:30,838
But when did it start?

1697
02:05:00,743 --> 02:05:02,620
<i>Now you're the witness here.</i>

1698
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:36,005
I thought about it.

1699
02:06:39,842 --> 02:06:41,468
Regarding of whether you die

1700
02:06:43,178 --> 02:06:44,305
or I die…

1701
02:06:50,185 --> 02:06:52,146
Would it be hell to live without you?

1702
02:06:55,316 --> 02:06:56,609
Or more hellish…

1703
02:07:01,363 --> 02:07:04,366
for you to know
that your daughter is watching this?

1704
02:07:37,733 --> 02:07:38,942
She isn't.

1705
02:07:43,989 --> 02:07:44,907
Huh?

1706
02:07:54,667 --> 02:07:56,085
It can't be true.

1707
02:07:58,671 --> 02:07:59,922
She didn't see it.

1708
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:05,761
She didn't.

1709
02:08:05,844 --> 02:08:07,971
No, please. She couldn't.

1710
02:08:31,036 --> 02:08:32,788
<i>Please, no.</i>

1711
02:09:14,538 --> 02:09:15,456
Mom?

1712
02:09:16,415 --> 02:09:17,583
You're home late.

1713
02:09:18,667 --> 02:09:19,585
Hmm.

1714
02:09:20,461 --> 02:09:21,378
Did I wake you?

1715
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:25,132
Just rest, okay?

1716
02:09:27,468 --> 02:09:28,427
Mom.

1717
02:09:44,777 --> 02:09:45,944
Long day?

1718
02:09:55,245 --> 02:09:56,121
Yeah.

1719
02:09:57,998 --> 02:09:59,458
You look tired.

1720
02:09:59,541 --> 02:10:00,417
Get some rest.

1721
02:10:02,377 --> 02:10:03,212
Okay.

1722
02:10:06,048 --> 02:10:06,882
Good night.

1723
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:11,303
Uh, here keep it like this.

1724
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:13,388
It's pretty stuffy.

1725
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:39,266
<i>Breaking news.</i>
<i>Newly elected Prime Minister Oh Jeong-sik</i>…

1726
02:11:39,349 --> 02:11:40,350
Jae-young!

1727
02:11:40,434 --> 02:11:44,354
<i>…was found dead inside his car</i>
<i>today at 12:18 p.m.</i>

1728
02:11:44,438 --> 02:11:47,190
-Gil Jae-young!
<i>-The cause was carbon-monoxide poisoning.</i>

1729
02:11:47,274 --> 02:11:49,401
<i>The police suspect</i>
<i>that this was a suicide</i>

1730
02:11:49,484 --> 02:11:52,321

<i>…following the death of his son.</i>

1733
02:11:57,659 --> 02:11:59,661
I just came to say goodbye to a friend.

1734
02:12:10,714 --> 02:12:12,799
Won't you say bye to your best friend?

1735
02:12:17,596 --> 02:12:18,639
My plan…

1736
02:12:21,141 --> 02:12:23,101
was to kiss you
in front of everybody here.

1737
02:12:25,646 --> 02:12:27,230
Or just murder you out back.

1738
02:12:37,908 --> 02:12:39,076
Take care.
