00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
សូមស្វាគមន៍មកកាន់ MonoPlays.com

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
សូមរីករាយទស្សនាដោយសេរី

3
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,720
Damn you demons and evil people.

4
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,960
By the look of you,

5
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,960
I guess you're the Master
of the Tianji Cabinet.

6
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,039
You walked here in the
evening in such a mess,

7
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,639
what is it that you want?

8
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,535
Please forgive me for
offending you at this late hour.

9
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,000
My master has asked you to
find an antidote for this poison.

10
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Or else the world will be

11
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,760
haunted by demonic creatures.

12
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Lay out the formation.

13
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,360
There are dog holes in the wall.

14
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Go quickly.

15
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Hurry up.

16
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Guard Zhan.

17
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Yeah.

18
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:30,880
Look at that.

19
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Well.

20
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:53,920
Guard Zhan.

21
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:54,640
You see.

22
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:55,679
Yes.

23
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
The Tianji Cabinet is a
secret sect of the Jianghu,

24
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
acting in a weird and unpredictable way.

25
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,119
This scratch changes from
deep to shallow into fine.

26
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,479
Is it really the work of a foreign beast?

27
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Guard Zhan.

28
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,160
Yes.

29
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,320
I found a seal in the front.

30
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,480
I don't know if it has
anything to do with the case.

31
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,479
Wei...

32
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Wu...

33
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,640
My Lord.

34
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
My lord.

35
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
The Emperor...

36
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,976
The emperor has asked
you to enter the palace.

37
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,600
What?

38
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:10,003
Go to the palace?

39
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,119
The emperor

40
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,239
wants me to buy onions.

41
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
Did you hear that right?

42
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,640
Yes.

43
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,160
Go to the palace.

44
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,880
Go to the palace.

45
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,976
It scared the hell out of me.

46
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,640
Gong Sun Ce.

47
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,559
Just speak clearly next time.

48
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
Last time that case,

49
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Lord Bao should not rush
out to step on the fuse.

50
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,279
The explosives not only didn't go out,

51
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,839
but also hurt his own ears.

52
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:38,239
That's right.

53
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,616
All day long he was yelling
about petitioning for the people,

54
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,279
and now,

55
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,760
he can't even hear his voice.

56
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Asshole.

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,119
Wang Chao, Mahan.

58
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,359
You say that I am not
clear in my judgments,

59
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,559
and you dare to slander my reputation.

60
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,559
Hum.

61
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,239
Mr. Bao.

62
00:06:59,359 --> 00:06:59,920
You're back.

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,600
Mr. Bao.

64
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,239
Yesterday's beast murder case,

65
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,416
the victims were all from Tianji Cabinet.

66
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
As far as I can see,

67
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
the dead

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,080
are covered with scratches,

69
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
as if

70
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,240
they were wounded by wild animals.

71
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,200
But after careful examination,

72
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,559
I found that the wounds

73
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,040
were very flat,

74
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,080
as if they were caused by a sharp weapon.

75
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,119
Guard Zhan.

76
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Louder.

77
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,559
Mr. Bao.

78
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,079
Yesterday's beast murder case,

79
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,398
the victims were all from Tianji Cabinet.

80
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,159
And their bodies were
covered with scratches,

81
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,119
as if they had been
wounded by sharp objects.

82
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,519
Guard Zhan.

83
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Clear analysis.

84
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,160
This case

85
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
is in your hands.

86
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,440
Water and Land puja

87
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
will be held soon.

88
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
There must be

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,279
no chaos.

90
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Yes.

91
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,799
I'm coming, Wu.

92
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,119
Here we go, brother.

93
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,479
It's all here.

94
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,039
It's coming.

95
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Brother,

96
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,599
you've sent so many mouse letters,

97
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,480
is there something you
want from your brothers?

98
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
I'm okay.

99
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,399
It was the Master of the
Tianji Cabinet who was killed,

100
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,559
just last night.

101
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,440
Dead?

102
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,559
That's not right.

103
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,639
The Tianji Cabinet knows
everything about the world.

104
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,880
The rule of the jianghu

105
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,239
is not to make enemies of them

106
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:52,682
So

107
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,399
Who did it?

108
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,840
Yeah.

109
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,455
The Master of the Tianji
Cabinet once helped me.

110
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,159
I had promised to do three things for her.

111
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,535
And now there is one thing
that has not been fulfilled.

112
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,599
I'll help her get revenge

113
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,599
and settle this debt.

114
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,320
No problem. I'm with you.

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,079
Brother don't worry, I'll help you.

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,440
Hmm.

117
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
But

118
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,400
where do we have to start?

119
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Yeah.

120
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,400
Find out

121
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,679
who uses this seal.

122
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,119
The guy

123
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,280
who didn't know any better

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,999
seemed to be looking into it,

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,679
which saved us a lot of work.

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
Royal cat.

127
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,880
This black powder is not a herb,

128
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,039
nor is it a stone powder.

129
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,520
I've been working with
medicinal herbs for half my life,

130
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,359
but I've never seen this.

131
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Gee-up.

132
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,719
Wu.

133
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,400
Who are you?

134
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,575
The fifth master of the Xian
Kong island, Bai Yutang.

135
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,736
Are you a stupid cat investigating
the Tianji Pavilion case?

136
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
The evidence of this case will be mine.

137
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,799
Rampant little thief.

138
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,479
Honestly,

139
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,895
do you have anything to do
with the Tianji Cabinet case?

140
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,919
So what's it to you?

141
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,519
You fucking rat, you dare to kick me.

142
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,919
You've got some skills.

143
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Yes.

144
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,159
Stop.

145
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:46,919
Hey.

146
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,000
Do you want it?

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Come and get it.

148
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,616
Both of these guys are good at kung fu.

149
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Yeah.

150
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:03,479
Look over there. They're fighting.

151
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,719
Come on.

152
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,039
Come and get it.

153
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,159
You stupid cat can't get it, can you?

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,880
Ah.

155
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:21,599
Hello.

156
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Come after me.

157
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
A bunch of losers

158
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,918
This kind of kung fu,

159
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,575
and still dare to come to the competition.

160
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:56,599
Sister.

161
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,118
When will I find

162
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,158
my soulmate?

163
00:12:59,159 --> 00:12:59,640
Sister.

164
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,119
Fate

165
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,479
is sometimes far away.

166
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,479
Far away?

167
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,119
Yeah.

168
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,479
Could there be a man

169
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,599
falling from the sky?

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,559
Not handsome enough, what else?

171
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
So handsome.

172
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,359
So handsome.

173
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
You're blind.

174
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,455
Are you saying he's better looking than me?

175
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,479
Go away.

176
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Brother Zhanzhao.

177
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,960
Are you here for the match?

178
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,200
Miss Ding.

179
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,239
I have official business to attend to,

180
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
so I'm sorry.

181
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Do you want to go there? Win me first.

182
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Sister.

183
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,159
Brother Zhanzhao.

184
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,719
You won me.

185
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:34,719
I...

186
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,640
Brother Zhanzhao.

187
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,799
Sister.

188
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Sister.

189
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Brother Zhanzhao.

190
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,239
Miss Ding.

191
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Much offense.

192
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Excuse me.

193
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Mr. Zhan.

194
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,520
Mr. Zhan.

195
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,000
You've dropped your stuff.

196
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,159
Thanks

197
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,719
I really didn't think that

198
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,798
this Miss Ding

199
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,280
would go blind at such a young age.

200
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
There's a gentleman

201
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,238
like me standing here,

202
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,200
but she actually looks at that stupid cat.

203
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,559
You.

204
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Get out.

205
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,239
Black powder.

206
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,359
Sister.

207
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,919
Is he nice?

208
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,679
Very nice.

209
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
How do you know he has good kidneys?

210
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,119
I feel it.

211
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,039
I feel it.

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Pang Tai Shi.

213
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,319
Don't you dare talk nonsense.

214
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,519
You... you're talking nonsense.

215
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,599
You're outrageous.

216
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
You're full of shit.

217
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:52,477
The emperor.

218
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:53,719
Execute the nine clans.

219
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I kill you.

220
00:16:59,173 --> 00:16:59,774
Miss

221
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,559
Calm down.

222
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,320
Now Lord Bao's ears are not very good,

223
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,479
so you should not bother with him.

224
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:05,146
Xiao Dezi.

225
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,239
I'm here.

226
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,879
You write down

227
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,560
what I said to Master Bao,

228
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,600
so that there won't be
another misunderstanding.

229
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:12,706
Yes, sir.

230
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,560
In a few days it will be
the Water Land Puja,

231
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,840
and I want to make some
changes to get closer to the people,

232
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,759
and I wonder what good
suggestions the two secretaries have.

233
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,960
Your Majesty.

234
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,800
I have an idea that I don't
know if it's appropriate.

235
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Please go ahead, Tai Shi.

236
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
I suggest that you,

237
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,839
Your Majesty, lead the
civil and military officials

238
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,320
to drink the water of Bianhe
River with the people in the puja.

239
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
The King and the people drink together

240
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,039
to show my pro-people heart.

241
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Nice.

242
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,399
Bao Zheng.

243
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,315
What do you think?

244
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,200
This is a very good method.

245
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
I second the motion.

246
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,759
Bao Zheng.

247
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,279
Is this sun coming out of the west?

248
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:03,119
I can't believe you agreed to this.

249
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,999
You're the one who's tired of living.

250
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,279
I've got a long life.

251
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,640
Miss Ding.

252
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm begging you to stop following me, okay?

253
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,215
Zhanzhao did not intend to
intrude into the Ding House,

254
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,400
I did not know that you
was competing in a marriage.

255
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,999
If it weren't for that Bai Yu Tang,

256
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,239
you would have found

257
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,838
the man of your choice.

258
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,199
I don't care.

259
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,376
You're the one who defeated me,

260
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,079
and you're my future husband.

261
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,055
Tell me, when will we get married?

262
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,496
I entered the Ding house by mistake,

263
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,719
but I didn't mean to.

264
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,959
If the you really wants to get married,

265
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,760
you can have another match.

266
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,040
Another match?

267
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,640
OK.

268
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,920
I'll do it again if you come.

269
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,959
I...

270
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,719
It's okay to say no.

271
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,376
Then I will now go to the
city to spread the word that

272
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
the Kaifeng House Zhan Zhao, Mr. Zhan.

273
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:54,759
Went to the Ding House match,

274
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,920
won the Ding Yuehua

275
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,479
and promised to marry her.

276
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,238
But now he met another girl

277
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,239
and changed his mind,

278
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,358
abandoned me and betrayed my trust,

279
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,598
always changing his words and no faith.

280
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:04,679
All right, Miss Ding, stop it.

281
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,799
All right, you have my word..

282
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Did you say yes to me?

283
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
I...

284
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,640
Oh my goodness.

285
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:12,239
Stupid cat.

286
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,679
You really don't know how to love.

287
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,598
Miss Ding, he doesn't want you,

288
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,040
there's me, I don't mind.

289
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
You white rat!

290
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,078
You dare to break into the Kaifeng House!

291
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,719
You get down here.

292
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:22,920
You get up here.

293
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Get your ass down here.

294
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
You get up here.

295
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,119
See if you come down.

296
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,656
The cat is in a hurry to jump off the wall.

297
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,838
I won't come down.

298
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,839
What's going on?

299
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,359
Baiyutang.

300
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,840
What the hell do you want?

301
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,307
I'm investigating the case.

302
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,376
To find out the real culprit
behind the Blood Wolf case

303
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,960
and get justice for the Tianji Cabinet.

304
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,359
You check yours.

305
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,199
I'll check mine.

306
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,639
What do you mean by pestering me?

307
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,221
It doesn't mean anything.

308
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,959
Who let you to call yourself a royal cat?

309
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,374
How can we five rats still
get along in the jianghu?

310
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,478
So I have nothing to do,

311
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,519
so I came to tease cat,
to take the piss out of you.

312
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I…

313
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Stinky rat.

314
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,040
You dare to molest my husband!

315
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,640
You, get down here!

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,640
I'll fight you alone.

317
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,439
Guard Zhan.

318
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,160
Guard Zhan.

319
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,478
Tell us what you found out.

320
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:09,719
We found the owner of the seal.

321
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,455
This is the private seal used
by Shanzhuang at the city port.

322
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,280
And the owner of Sunjang

323
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,319
was Lu Youxin, the great kind man.

324
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,560
Thanks a lot, stupid cat.

325
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Good.

326
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,959
Brother Zhanzhao.

327
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:24,680
Lord Zhan.

328
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Sister.

329
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,000
How come you can't feel me?

330
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Lord Xiao.

331
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,919
My sister is always giving me trouble.

332
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I'll go first.

333
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,095
The cat catching the
mouse is a law that has

334
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,736
been in place since
the beginning of time.

335
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Do you understand?

336
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Knock it off.

337
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,119
Lu Youxin.

338
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,599
He is Lu Youxin.

339
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Right.

340
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,640
The house door was unlocked.

341
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,199
There were no signs of a
struggle in the house again.

342
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,319
It seems that the murderer and
Lu Youxin were acquaintances.

343
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
This wound

344
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,000
should have been scratched after his death.

345
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
This suggests that

346
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
the killer was trying to
destroy some kind of evidence.

347
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,760
Just so you know, white rat.

348
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,760
And where is the killer now?

349
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I'll tell you what.

350
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,959
This door was unlocked

351
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,759
and the windows and doors
inside the house were intact,

352
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,880
which means

353
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,016
there must be a secret
room inside this house

354
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
What about the direction?

355
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,519
From the blood trail

356
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,799
of Lu Youxin's body being
dragged, it's easy to see that

357
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,118
the approximate orientation of this chamber

358
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,236
would be at...

359
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,640
That should be it.

360
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,719
The killer,

361
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,639
who was going to drag the body that way,

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,358
our arrival disrupted his plans.

363
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,280
In an emergency

364
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:26,000
he dragged the body
backwards to cover it up,

365
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,839
thus cutting his arm.

366
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,736
The golden cicada escapes by crafty scheme.

367
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,199
So

368
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,360
The direction of the
secret room should be in…

369
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,838
Is that right there?

370
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,600
You're lucky to have guessed what I meant.

371
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I told you so.

372
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,643
Zhanzhao.

373
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,319
Brother Zhanzhao.

374
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,319
Miss Ding.

375
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,720
Miss Ding, I'm working on a case.

376
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Lu Youxin is dead.

377
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,999
You can't even see Lu
Youxin's face from that position.

378
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,800
How did you know it was him?

379
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,199
I was just...

380
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,335
What do you mean, stinky mouse?

381
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,958
This is Lu Youxin's study,

382
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,759
if he didn't die, would
there be someone else?

383
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,079
That's right.

384
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,399
Sorry about that, Mr. Xiao.

385
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,039
Lord Xiao, are you hurt?

386
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
I'm fine.

387
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:25,519
Miss Ding, it's more dangerous here.

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,776
Either you go back first, right?

389
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,920
Brother Zhanzhao, are
you concerned about me?

390
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,256
I'm worried about your personal safety.

391
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,440
Why don't you go back first?

392
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,520
You guys take your time, I'll go first.

393
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,119
You wait.

394
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,359
I'll be right back.

395
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,078
Brother Zhanzhao, I'm going too.

396
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,119
Sister, it's dangerous
inside, I will protect you.

397
00:23:55,955 --> 00:23:56,514
Brother.

398
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,440
It must be because there's an
ulterior motive for the little secret.

399
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,199
It's okay, don't be afraid.

400
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
That's weird.

401
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,239
What's so weird, white mouse?

402
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,959
Why should I tell you

403
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,040
if I'm called a white rat?

404
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Brother Zhanzhao.

405
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:16,839
It's the wolf.

406
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,560
Don't be afraid.

407
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,119
Stay behind me.

408
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
What the hell is that?

409
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Let's see.

410
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,520
Get out and let it go, get help.

411
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,280
Be careful, brother.

412
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,319
Go.

413
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,400
Fifth Brother is in trouble.

414
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,079
Go.

415
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,319
Go.

416
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,079
Mr. Zhan, this is Xiao Li.

417
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,400
Mr. Xiao, so it's you.

418
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,959
Stupid cat, you're blind.

419
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,799
Xiao brother and wolf you can not tell.

420
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,760
No bullshit, quick alert.

421
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:17,775
Are you okay, brother?

422
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Yes.

423
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,800
You dare to touch my man,

424
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,920
you don't even know

425
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:26,439
what I'm capable of.

426
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,359
Brother.

427
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
Brother.

428
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,119
Are you all right, brother?

429
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Mr. Xiao.

430
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,719
Are you sure you're okay?

431
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,119
It's okay.

432
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,040
Brother.

433
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
You're bleeding.

434
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,719
Mr. Bao

435
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Yesterday's beast murder case,

436
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,320
the victims were all from Tianji Cabinet.

437
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
As far as I could see,

438
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,640
the dead body was covered with scratches,

439
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,400
as if they had been
wounded by wild animals.

440
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,760
But upon my closer examination,

441
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,959
I found that the wounds were very flat,

442
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,520
as if they were caused
by a sharp instrument.

443
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,279
The killers of the Tianji
Cabinet murders are all here.

444
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,160
They were obviously human,

445
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,183
so why did we see

446
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,800
wolves that day?

447
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,838
I took a little black powder

448
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:35,839
from you that day.

449
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,160
It was stolen.

450
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
That doesn't even matter.

451
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,598
My second brother has investigated

452
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,079
the source of that black powder.

453
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,920
It's the snake venom of the
Nine-Quartered King Snake.

454
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,920
It's not fatal, but it can
cause hallucinations.

455
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Hallucinations?

456
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
So that's it.

457
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,879
That's the secret they're trying to hide.

458
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,078
This tattoo and everything in the chamber

459
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,079
proves that

460
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,160
they are the Skywolf clan.

461
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,839
That Lu Youxin

462
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,079
is also a member of the Skywolf clan.

463
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,119
Mr. Bao.

464
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,159
The murderer of the Tianji
Cabinet case has been found out,

465
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,519
and it is the Skywolf Clan.

466
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Guard Zhan.

467
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
What did you say?

468
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,599
He said that the killer was the Skywolves.

469
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,839
Wolves and pigs?

470
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,198
How do you run the case?

471
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:10,199
So absurd.

472
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,959
What face do I have to explain
to the emperor and the people?

473
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
My Lord.

474
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,160
Not wolves and pigs.

475
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,599
It's the Skywolves.

476
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:24,199
It's the Skywolf Clan.

477
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,359
Zhanzhao, come up, come up and say.

478
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,119
Yes.

479
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Mr. Bao

480
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,719
Ever since the court

481
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,935
sent troops to purge the
Skywolf clan for rebellion,

482
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,719
they have been in hiding for many years.

483
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,319
This time they have
reappeared in the capital,

484
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,160
they must have a plan.

485
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,719
Then, according to Guard Zhan, it means...

486
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,560
They've come back

487
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,079
to take revenge on the court.

488
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,839
Zhanzhao.

489
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:56,640
What do you think?

490
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,239
If

491
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
Their goal is the imperial court,

492
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
why do they want to
bloodbath the Tianji Cabinet?

493
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,400
I've checked it out.

494
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
The steel claws on this wolf man's hands

495
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,198
exactly match the wounds on the victim

496
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:08,439
at the crime scene in Tianji Cabinet.

497
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,159
And

498
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,439
Lu Youxin's seal

499
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,560
was also at the Tianji Cabinet crime scene.

500
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,279
It means that Lu Youxin

501
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,736
must have something to do with this case.

502
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,520
When we investigated Lu Youxin's house,

503
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,839
he had already been silenced.

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,399
This means that someone was behind this

505
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,079
and prevented us from investigating.

506
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:24,840
And

507
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,600
is there anyone to suspect?

508
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Xiao Li.

509
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Who?

510
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
Xiao Li.

511
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:37,600
Daring.

512
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,719
Xiao Li was an official of the court

513
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,879
and always did his duty.

514
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,320
Suspect him?

515
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,159
Do you have proof?

516
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,800
There is no conclusive evidence yet.

517
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,360
But according to my speculation,

518
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,399
they know that the seal
fell into the hands of us,

519
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,415
and sooner or later they
will investigate Lu Youxin,

520
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,159
so they will definitely
kill to silence him.

521
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,320
And that day at the Ding House,

522
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,158
it was Xiao Li who took Lu Youxin's seal

523
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,159
and gave it to me.

524
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,120
The contents of the seal
were seen only by him.

525
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,360
From the time he got the seal to
the time we investigated Lu's house,

526
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,158
he had all this time

527
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,120
to tip off and kill people.

528
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,455
The most important thing is that dead.

529
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,120
When Xiao Li arrived at Lu's house,

530
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,776
he even did not look at the
deceased clearly in that case,

531
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
and said out of the blue:

532
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,239
Lu Youxin is dead，

533
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,879
Lu Youxin is dead.

534
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It is clear that

535
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,360
he already knew that the
deceased is Lu Youxin.

536
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:27,760
This case is very involved

537
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:28,959
and not trivial.

538
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,520
Since there are clues, Zhanzhao,

539
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,440
this case will be fully handed
over to you to investigate.

540
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Remember,

541
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:38,320
nothing can go wrong.

542
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Yes.

543
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Brother Zhanzhao.

544
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,120
Are you scared silly?

545
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,925
How can you doubt my brother?

546
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,959
Who saved us that
day at the risk of his life?

547
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,679
Miss Ding.

548
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:53,695
Xiao Li's kung fu is beneath
both me and the white mouse.

549
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,719
In the white mist,

550
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,040
why did we all suffer repeated attacks?

551
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,360
And yet he was able to come
to our rescue many times.

552
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,425
He was trying to get at us.

553
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,096
What caused me the most suspicion was that

554
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
the wound on his body

555
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
was not scratched by a wolf's claw,

556
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:09,719
but by a sword wound.

557
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,719
It was my sword.

558
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,959
Then you can't assume that

559
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,613
my brother is one of the wolves

560
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,959
just because he received a sword wound.

561
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,280
Miss Ding is right.

562
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,284
You can't just guess like that

563
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,079
and say that Miss Ding's brother,

564
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,360
is the murderer.

565
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,215
The case should be
investigated with evidence.

566
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,079
The case is the process
of pulling out the threads

567
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,336
and stringing together the clues.

568
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Speculation

569
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,160
is just a way to get to the truth faster.

570
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Miss Ding.

571
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
If you believe me,

572
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,759
do not let Xiao Li get suspicious.

573
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,399
If he is innocent,

574
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,999
I will certainly give him justice.

575
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,320
Miss Ding, I'm on your side.

576
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,200
You'll be my witness when the time comes.

577
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,360
When I find out the real
murderer in this case,

578
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,319
the name of the imperial cat
Zhanzhao will be changed to stupid cat,

579
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,336
unable to distinguish
between right and wrong.

580
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Guard Zhan.

581
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,840
Guard Zhan.

582
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Mr. Xiao is awake.

583
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,159
My brother is awake.

584
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:17,159
My brother.

585
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,239
Mr. Xiao.

586
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,080
You're here.

587
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Brother.

588
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,175
Are you okay with your injuries?

589
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,199
Not a problem.

590
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,879
It's just a little scary
now that I think about it.

591
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,120
I've never seen anything so strange.

592
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,360
It was white smoke and mist,

593
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,719
and what I clearly saw,

594
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,120
was a werewolf coming at me.

595
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,439
But why,

596
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,599
I received a sword wound?

597
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,359
Who knows which one of you

598
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,605
stabbed the wrong person?

599
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,959
Mr. Xiao,

600
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,640
That day, there was a lot of fog,

601
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,695
I did not distinguish
between friend and foe,

602
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,639
and hurt Lord Xiao by
mistake, I am really sorry.

603
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Who can see clearly

604
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:51,479
at a critical moment?

605
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:53,496
Mr. Zhan, you don't have to blame yourself.

606
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,720
It's okay，brother, you take
care of your injuries first.

607
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,399
I'll get you the best doctor in town.

608
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Forget it.

609
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,359
I've sort of come back from the dead

610
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,919
and picked up a life.

611
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,239
But Mr. Xiao,

612
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,639
that blood wolf thing

613
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,639
now I have a clue.

614
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:10,879
When I was

615
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,719
in Lu Youxin's secret room,

616
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,159
I found that

617
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,199
there seemed to be something
else at the end of that room,

618
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:18,959
so

619
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,760
I was going to take
someone to check it out.

620
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,000
Mr. Zhan, are you still going
to that dangerous place?

621
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,719
The end of the chamber

622
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,759
must be related to the Blood Wolf case.

623
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
If I don't step up my investigation,

624
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,655
the culprit will learn about it

625
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,519
and I'm afraid they'll
go to destroy the clues.

626
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
In that case, then,

627
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Mr. Zhan,

628
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,920
you should go and investigate the clues

629
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:39,560
so that they are not lost.

630
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
Then you rest in peace.

631
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,920
Brother, you take care of your injuries.

632
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,239
Brother.

633
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Brother.

634
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,519
Didn't you say you were going to
the secret room of the Lu House?

635
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,040
You'll believe whatever
the stupid cat says.

636
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,800
So, why don't you believe him

637
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,336
when he says he doesn't love you?

638
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,398
It's impossible to believe this one.

639
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:34,399
You don't talk nonsense.

640
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,679
You guys stop arguing.

641
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,855
I deliberately mentioned the
secret room of the Lu House

642
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,120
to see his reaction.

643
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,639
The human expression
does not deceive itself.

644
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:44,360
But

645
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
I had a vague feeling

646
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,600
that he was a little weird.

647
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,040
Are you still suspicious of my brother?

648
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,040
He was wounded in the chamber,

649
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:54,439
and it makes sense that
he would have palpitations

650
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,280
at the mention of the chamber.

651
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
But you should know that

652
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,040
being afraid and being
nervous are two different things.

653
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
Xiao Li was also in
charge of the city defense,

654
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,520
which was his job.

655
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,239
But I got the feeling that

656
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,199
he didn't seem to want
me to keep looking into it.

657
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
White rat.

658
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,960
Didn't you always want
to compare yourself to me?

659
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:15,639
Say two words.

660
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
I'll tell you what.

661
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,199
Do you remember

662
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:23,360
what we saw in the autopsy room?

663
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,479
Are you talking about the tattoos
on the arms of those werewolves?

664
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:28,935
What are you talking about?

665
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,158
Every one of the Skywolf clan

666
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,879
has a tattoo on his arm.

667
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,560
If Xiao Li also has this tattoo on his arm,

668
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,479
then it would confirm that
my suspicions are correct.

669
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,336
Then you don't have to guess on this one.

670
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,639
My brother and I grew up together,

671
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,760
and he doesn't have
any tattoos on his arms.

672
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:46,120
His arm is whiter than my arm.

673
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,120
That's just you're very dark, right?

674
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,958
You're the one who's black.
Your whole family is black.

675
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:50,959
You're the black mouse.

676
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,895
Don't argue. Black or not black...

677
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:54,919
Ah no.

678
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:55,879
Whether there is one or
not is obvious at a glance.

679
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Whether there is one or
not is obvious at a glance.

680
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,600
My brother has always done his duty

681
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:11,159
and comes to guard the city
room every day at this hour.

682
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:12,520
Brother Zhanzhao.

683
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:14,519
I'll have my own way in a minute.

684
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,800
I'll let you drop this suspicion
of my righteous brother.

685
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Checking the case

686
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,919
is not to let go of any clues.

687
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,679
Water and Land puja deployment map,

688
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Ma Zhuang village,

689
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,497
the map of Wu Qing village,

690
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,759
in Mr. Xiao's deployment map,

691
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
how is not it?

692
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,560
I think

693
00:42:05,561 --> 00:42:06,879
this Wuqing village,

694
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,719
perennial rain disaster,

695
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,520
is equal to a ruined village,

696
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:13,320
and the location is remote,

697
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
no one comes,

698
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
should not be unusual.

699
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:17,879
Mr. Xiao.

700
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,115
What brings you here?

701
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,040
Go inside.

702
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Go.

703
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,919
Sister.

704
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
Why are you here?

705
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,810
I knew you wouldn't be
at home resting properly,

706
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:39,399
I caught you.

707
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,918
You have not yet
recovered from your injuries,

708
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:43,799
I have specially boiled tonic for you

709
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,520
and brought it to you.

710
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,080
You still care about me the most.

711
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:47,280
Then I'll go and serve it to you.

712
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,399
Hmm.

713
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,375
Water and land puja will be held soon,

714
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,040
all around must be closely guarded,

715
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,760
there must not be a single mistake.

716
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Get on it quickly.

717
00:42:58,479 --> 00:42:59,479
Yes.

718
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,239
Mr. Xiao,

719
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,935
You are not yet recovered
from your serious injuries,

720
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,559
why don't you know how to rest and rest?

721
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm fine.

722
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
You get on it quickly.

723
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Yes.

724
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,439
Brother.

725
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,215
Is everything all right, brother?

726
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:12,760
Quickly take it.

727
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:13,801
I'll check it out for you.

728
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
No, right?

729
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:16,959
No.

730
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:17,959
Righteous sister.

731
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,679
What's not? No what?

732
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,677
I'll show you if there's any burns.

733
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'll check this side.

734
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Nothing, right?

735
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,760
No.

736
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
I'm not hurt, sister.

737
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,520
It's okay.

738
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,280
It's okay.

739
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,520
It's okay.

740
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Brother.

741
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,135
Why don't you go and
change your clothes first?

742
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,159
Okay.

743
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Go go go.

744
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,360
See what I mean? See clearly?

745
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,999
I told you

746
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,280
there's no tattoo on my brother.

747
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,439
That's weird.

748
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,559
This Xiao Li is seriously wounded,

749
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,560
but he is doing his duty,

750
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
so he is a good officer.

751
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,479
Yeah, I said my brother is fine.

752
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
Brother Zhanzhao.

753
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:14,319
If you can come up with half the strength
to investigate the case to chase me,

754
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,639
I am willing to die

755
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,639
even if it is.

756
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,160
Why do you always put
yourself in the picture?

757
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:21,879
None of your business.

758
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:26,718
This only proves that Xiao Li

759
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,040
is not a member of the Wolf Clan

760
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,560
But Xiao Li's suspicions
can't be ruled out yet

761
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:32,239
Zhan Zhao

762
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,639
You haven't given up yet?

763
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:35,879
White rat

764
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:37,439
What Now

765
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:38,679
That's funny.

766
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,800
You're begging me now?

767
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,040
Let's go.

768
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:45,786
Go

769
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,120
Wu

770
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:49,559
How's the case going?

771
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
Yes

772
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,040
After all, Zhan Zhao is a
member of the government

773
00:44:54,439 --> 00:44:55,976
and is too concerned
about the rules of the court

774
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,718
It's no match for the methods used

775
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,199
by those of us who are not in office.

776
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,199
Brother

777
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,800
What are you going to do next?

778
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:07,599
Naturally, I'm going to use my magic pill

779
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
that works every time!

780
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:11,479
Brother, you can't be

781
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,159
Drugging

782
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,122
It's not that difficult

783
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:19,479
The key is who is
responsible for the seduction

784
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,678
Among our team

785
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,872
In terms of looks

786
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:27,678
it's the brother, I can reluctantly agree

787
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,719
to dress up as a woman

788
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,639
I'm only 28 years old

789
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:32,760
Disgusting

790
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,840
What are you thinking?

791
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,879
This medicine is not for that

792
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,959
What are you two playing at?

793
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,519
This ecstasy is exactly the same

794
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,479
as the one I have

795
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,679
Brother, please listen
to what Wu has to say

796
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,400
This medicine can make
a person tell the truth

797
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,879
if they smell it.

798
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:58,679
Great

799
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,199
Let adversity be good

800
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,120
Making the Impossible Possible

801
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,199
It's still up to me

802
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,359
After the event

803
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,439
I'll have to take the title
of "Royal Cat" from you

804
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,320
What's he doing?

805
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:20,041
He's not going to poison my brother, is he?

806
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,800
Do it, you'll find out later.

807
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,280
This drug is called "Soul
Powder" and is tasteless.

808
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,678
Feverish after inhalation

809
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:40,199
Turned into a trance

810
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:42,800
Until now it has worked every time

811
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,919
Until now it has worked every time

812
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:57,919
Brother

813
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,360
Brother, brother, brother,
what's wrong with you, brother?

814
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,642
Brother, Brother, Brother,
What's wrong with you, Brother?

815
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:06,056
You're not going to poison
anyone with this medicine, are you?

816
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
No, it won't.

817
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:07,679
Ok

818
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,959
From now on, be honest.

819
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,600
Something very serious

820
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,600
Don't say a word or I'll beat you up

821
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:14,800
Yes

822
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,439
What is your real identity

823
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,599
Xiao Li, City Watch Officer of Kaifeng

824
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,520
What does the Wolf
Clan have to do with you?

825
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,080
No

826
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,720
The case of the Bloody Wolves of the Tianji
Cabinet may have something to do with you

827
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:27,479
No

828
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,439
You killed Lu Youxin

829
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:30,740
No

830
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,000
Have you done anything wrong

831
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:33,560
to hide from the government?

832
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:36,159
Yes

833
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:39,919
What is it

834
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:42,959
Three years ago, I was on
patrol in the middle of the night

835
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
and peed in the moat

836
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
because I had to.

837
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:49,399
The end of that secret room in the Lu House

838
00:47:49,879 --> 00:47:51,360
Are there secrets of the Wolf Clan?

839
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,320
Brother

840
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:55,719
Brother

841
00:47:55,879 --> 00:47:57,439
That's a bit of a cheat, isn't it?

842
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,800
Are you sure this medicine works?

843
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
Of course it does

844
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:03,399
That's fine

845
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,399
Excellent

846
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:05,399
Brother

847
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Sir

848
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Sir

849
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Sir

850
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,359
It seems that this medicine

851
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,439
is very powerful

852
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:35,199
So, do you think it'll work?

853
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,800
It's working even if it doesn't.

854
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:39,919
This medicine doesn't seem right

855
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:41,879
I don't think it's that simple

856
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:43,639
You've figured it out

857
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,398
My brother gave me that medicine.

858
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:47,679
Vertigo medication

859
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:49,879
What does it mean?

860
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:51,479
It's a game again

861
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,992
This is indeed a game

862
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
The medicine didn't work

863
00:48:54,919 --> 00:48:56,479
Instead he continues to act

864
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,895
That means he must have had a problem

865
00:48:57,919 --> 00:48:59,520
And he couldn't answer when I asked him

866
00:48:59,879 --> 00:49:00,919
He just pretended to faint

867
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,239
That's right.

868
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:04,280
But the idea was mine

869
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,234
So I win this time

870
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Who says you win?

871
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:08,479
Do you have proof?

872
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,080
I'm a witness

873
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,919
I didn't see it.

874
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,320
I just looked at his books

875
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:17,239
Xiao Li traded six tons of grain
and hay with Shanzhuang every week

876
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:18,719
This is

877
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:21,159
far more than the number
of men he needs to supply

878
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,560
And the last day

879
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,560
was the day Lu Youxin died

880
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:28,599
It seems there must be
something wrong with that place

881
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,879
Thank you for the clue

882
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
So where are you going?

883
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,560
I'm going to get the game back

884
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,351
Zhanzhao, wait for me

885
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,600
Don't show off

886
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,399
I'd like to see you get this one back

887
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,093
Brother, wait for me

888
00:49:46,254 --> 00:49:47,254
Go

889
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:48,959
Zhanzhao

890
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:50,320
Wait for me

891
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,760
Brother

892
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,840
Can you make a less ritualistic appearance?

893
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:57,199
It's scary.

894
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,199
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

895
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,880
A Mysterious Woman Enters the Lu House

896
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,879
It seems that I may not lose.

897
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,080
Brother

898
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,439
Where are you going?

899
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:24,639
Stinky Mouse

900
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,480
How can you be faster than us?

901
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:29,800
Of course

902
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,040
Stupid cat

903
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,280
Looks like I've won again

904
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,199
I never thought I'd get along with you

905
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:36,975
You and I are not related

906
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,840
All Thanks to Xiao Li

907
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,080
What

908
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,199
Stinky Mouse

909
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,919
Don't steal a man from me

910
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,899
Who wants to steal
this stupid cat from you?

911
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:50,199
I guess there's something in there for you.

912
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Go, go in.

913
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:54,239
Brother. - Brother.

914
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,879
Brother, this is not a female ghost, is it?

915
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Boss

916
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,399
Liuyin has failed you

917
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,439
Not only did I expose my identity,

918
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,239
but I also put your life at risk.

919
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:18,199
I'm coming to see you

920
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:20,959
Wait

921
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,446
Who are you

922
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:24,719
Girl

923
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,639
If you die so unaccountably

924
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,120
What a waste

925
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:29,639
of Mr. Lu's kindness to you!

926
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,445
Who the hell are you?

927
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,120
This is Zhan Zhao

928
00:51:37,479 --> 00:51:39,639
who is the lord of the Kaifeng

929
00:51:39,919 --> 00:51:40,919
This

930
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Commoners

931
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,280
Greetings to Lord Zhan

932
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:48,639
I am Liu Yin

933
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Miss Liu

934
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,439
The killer has not yet been found.

935
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:54,679
If you really want to
bring justice to Mr. Lu

936
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,879
Why don't you tell me everything you know

937
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
On the Day

938
00:52:00,479 --> 00:52:02,320
I have been ordered by my master

939
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,120
to bring a mysterious poison

940
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,560
to the Master of the Tianji Cabinet

941
00:52:06,879 --> 00:52:08,159
and hope to find the antidote

942
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:10,800
But I didn't expect to
encounter a blood wolf

943
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:12,719
Fortunately

944
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:14,559
There's a dog hole in the Tianji Cabinet

945
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:15,919
I

946
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,159
Was able to escape

947
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,080
but

948
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,919
The master died

949
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:23,360
Lu Youxin is a member of the Wolf Clan

950
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,600
Death is deserved

951
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,959
Although my master is a Wolf

952
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,879
His only enemy is the Emperor

953
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:31,776
He didn't want his
people to kill the innocent

954
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,479
He sensed that the Wolves

955
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,919
were secretly developing a poisonous water

956
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,040
but I don't know what it's all about

957
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:39,800
And can't stop it

958
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:41,638
Only one step ahead

959
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,119
Search for the antidote to the poison

960
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,760
What Kind of Poison

961
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:50,959
Who

962
00:52:53,439 --> 00:52:54,439
You've been hit by a dart

963
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,760
I'm ok

964
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,600
I don't want to live anyway.

965
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:06,040
Oh no

966
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,040
This dart is poisonous

967
00:53:08,879 --> 00:53:09,879
Miss Liu

968
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
Miss Liu

969
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:12,639
Hold on

970
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:14,040
The Wolf Clan is

971
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,800
in the upper

972
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,360
Bian river

973
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
Miss Liu

974
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,239
Miss Liu

975
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,880
In the upper Bian river...

976
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,199
Wuqing Village

977
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:35,639
No wonder

978
00:53:35,959 --> 00:53:37,239
On the armorial map

979
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:39,320
I don't see any fortifications here

980
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,360
I thought it was a deserted village.

981
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,959
The Wolf Clan must be
in the village of Wuqing

982
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
That's right.

983
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Just now Miss Liu said

984
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,320
that this poison must be related
to the stratagy of the Wolf Clan

985
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,280
And Xiao Li spared no expense

986
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:56,679
To conceal the hiding
place of the Wolf Clan

987
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,760
And

988
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,400
his daily trade in provisions
with the good bank

989
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,079
was greater than the number of his troops

990
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,080
All these signs indicate that

991
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,000
Xiao Li and the Wolf
Clan are definitely related

992
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,680
But trying to destroy the Wolf Clan

993
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:14,280
we have one more important thing to do

994
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,159
Why are you suddenly interested in

995
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,959
the records of the village of Wuqing

996
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,520
Nothing sir

997
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,239
I just wanted to ask

998
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,719
Why is the village of Wuqing
the only one in the capital fortified

999
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,638
This village has been
abandoned for a long time

1000
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:34,439
The Emperor promoted hard
work, frugality and love for his people

1001
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,640
And indeed there was
no need to waste military

1002
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,639
and financial resources

1003
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,879
on a deserted village

1004
00:54:41,399 --> 00:54:42,479
If it was thrifty,

1005
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,000
then why did you need
so much military food?

1006
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,320
As far as I know

1007
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:49,135
You have purchased far more food

1008
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,560
than your army needs!

1009
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,999
There is a long famine in other cities

1010
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,959
The purchase of military rations
is only a charity to be given out

1011
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,399
This can be traced

1012
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:01,760
There are so many other
cities, and you are so sophomoric

1013
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,040
If I may say

1014
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:05,439
It's like you're harbouring
criminals, Lord Shaw.

1015
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,159
A group of bandits raised on

1016
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,639
surplus army rations and
hidden in a deserted village

1017
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:12,479
That could be done without knowing

1018
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,880
If you want to condemn
me, you'll have plenty to say.

1019
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,639
If you don't believe me

1020
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:19,399
I'm going with you to the village of Wuqing

1021
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,960
You'll know it when you see it

1022
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:23,959
Yes, please.

1023
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,199
This is it.

1024
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:14,360
You see, it's been
abandoned for a long time.

1025
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Who are you?

1026
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Dare to come here

1027
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,960
The Kaifeng Office is working

1028
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,280
And who are you?

1029
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:26,879
Kaifeng Office

1030
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,760
Boss, they're not poisoned.

1031
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,000
Brother, I'm here to help you.

1032
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,159
Of course it's not poisoned

1033
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,760
The black hallucinogenic powder you use

1034
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,919
has no effect

1035
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:11,062
on the horsetail I found.

1036
00:57:14,399 --> 00:57:17,120
The black powder you
found at the crime scene

1037
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:20,280
was made from the venom
of the Nine-Bent King Snake

1038
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,239
After my research

1039
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,120
I found a plant called La Liao Cao

1040
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:28,519
that can cure the hallucinations
caused by this poison

1041
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,760
One for each of these purses

1042
00:57:30,919 --> 00:57:33,719
will be safe from the
illusions of these bad guys

1043
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,520
Kill

1044
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,600
Brother

1045
00:58:47,919 --> 00:58:48,439
Lord Xiao

1046
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,159
Brother

1047
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,280
Lord Xiao

1048
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Lord Xiao

1049
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:54,399
Brother, you hold on

1050
00:58:54,879 --> 00:58:57,040
Hang in there, brother.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1051
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
So

1052
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,800
I, Xiao,

1053
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,760
in this life

1054
00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:06,719
I'm pure

1055
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Mr. Xiao

1056
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,040
Sorry

1057
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,320
I was wrong to blame you

1058
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,159
Lord Xiao

1059
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,919
Brother

1060
00:59:18,919 --> 00:59:19,919
Lord Xiao

1061
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:21,320
Brother

1062
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,120
Wake up, brother

1063
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,040
Brother

1064
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:29,479
Brother

1065
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,360
Brother

1066
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:34,639
Lord Xiao

1067
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,039
Wei

1068
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,959
Wu

1069
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,399
Lord Bao

1070
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,840
Zhan Zhao

1071
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,320
What are you doing?

1072
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:08,080
Sir

1073
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,280
The death of Lord Xiao

1074
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,959
was due entirely to an
error in judgment on my part

1075
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,120
that led to his death

1076
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,040
Please convict

1077
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:22,800
Zhan Zhao

1078
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,120
Emergency

1079
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,639
Xiao Chengshou Died for You

1080
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,800
And you didn't mean to

1081
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:29,760
stab him with that sword

1082
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,320
He wouldn't have died

1083
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,199
if I hadn't disobeyed the orders

1084
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,615
and asked him to accompany
me to Wuqing Village to confront

1085
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:36,760
If I am not judged

1086
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,199
I cannot live my life in peace

1087
01:00:39,379 --> 01:00:40,379
This Officer

1088
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:41,719
I am ashamed to do it again

1089
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You want me

1090
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,280
How to convict you

1091
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,320
Then I will confess my guilt to the Emperor

1092
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:53,719
No

1093
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,479
When it

1094
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
comes to the Emperor,

1095
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:57,719
there is no turning back

1096
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:03,800
Stupid cat

1097
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,320
You don't have to be an officer

1098
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:06,599
But I must have your name

1099
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,759
royal cat

1100
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,919
come out and fight with me

1101
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:12,120
Or else I will always be a step behind you

1102
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:13,799
I don't want to be an officer

1103
01:01:13,959 --> 01:01:15,839
Naturally, it doesn't
deserve the name royal Cat

1104
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:17,199
You win

1105
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,320
No

1106
01:01:18,399 --> 01:01:20,399
I'm going to fight you fair and square

1107
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,600
Come out and fight with me

1108
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,080
After the match

1109
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,800
I don't care if you go to the Emperor

1110
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,280
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1111
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:45,719
Lord Bao

1112
01:01:46,919 --> 01:01:48,520
Why didn't they do it?

1113
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,600
It

1114
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:53,560
It's the battle of the masters

1115
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:55,399
Use their eyes as swords

1116
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,000
Seemingly unmoved

1117
01:01:57,399 --> 01:01:58,399
but actually

1118
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:00,600
a 300-round battle

1119
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,120
Stinky Rat

1120
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,360
be careful

1121
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,320
Don't hurt my Zhanzhao

1122
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,080
Why don't you do it?

1123
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,280
Do it!

1124
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:25,999
Why didn't you fight back?

1125
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:27,919
I admit defeat

1126
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
It's a fair fight

1127
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Don't fight

1128
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
Sir, sir

1129
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:35,199
Is it all right?

1130
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:36,560
Are you all right, sir?

1131
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,080
Gongsun Ce

1132
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:40,199
Keep your voice down, I can hear you

1133
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
Sir

1134
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,520
Are you all right?

1135
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:46,479
Yes, I'm fine.

1136
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,520
Sir, Your ears are getting better!

1137
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:54,959
It's true!

1138
01:02:56,679 --> 01:02:57,639
I've got this ear

1139
01:02:57,639 --> 01:02:58,639
The adult's ear is fine

1140
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:00,199
You two stop fighting

1141
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:01,959
Guard Zhan

1142
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:03,639
About You

1143
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,160
I cannot handle this officer

1144
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:06,679
sir

1145
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,080
In that case

1146
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,160
I will enter the palace and invite

1147
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,479
Emperor's order is here

1148
01:03:20,399 --> 01:03:21,399
Guard Zhan

1149
01:03:21,879 --> 01:03:23,560
What the hell is going on?

1150
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:24,719
Emperor

1151
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,479
Xiao Chengshou is loyal

1152
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,000
Willing to die to show my own heart

1153
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,679
to Kill the Wolf Clan for the Emperor

1154
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,600
However, Zhan Zhao is
very stubborn and conceited

1155
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:36,760
He was afraid of being
robbed of his credit,

1156
01:03:36,919 --> 01:03:38,158
so he took advantage of the confusion

1157
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,560
to kill Xiao Chengshou

1158
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,280
This is not true

1159
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:44,280
What the guard Zhan did

1160
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:46,760
Just to find out what happened

1161
01:03:47,479 --> 01:03:49,840
Xiao Chengshou's Death was Just an accident

1162
01:03:51,919 --> 01:03:52,919
Guard Zhan

1163
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,360
what is the crime

1164
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,719
I have heard

1165
01:03:57,399 --> 01:04:00,560
The guard Zhan had repeatedly
tested Xiao Chengshou on

1166
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,479
Also used unusual methods

1167
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:05,000
and later even killed him

1168
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,679
which shows the
viciousness of his intentions

1169
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,080
on that day

1170
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,760
As witnessed by all who were present

1171
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:14,639
Even the sister of Xiao Chengshou

1172
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,600
also said that the incident was accidental

1173
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,040
Accidental

1174
01:04:19,479 --> 01:04:20,479
If Accidental

1175
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:21,878
What did Zhan Zhao come to ask for?

1176
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:22,879
The Master

1177
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:25,560
You are the one who is
slandering without evidence

1178
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,239
you

1179
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:27,239
you

1180
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,560
Okay, okay

1181
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,320
You guys stop fighting

1182
01:04:33,399 --> 01:04:34,399
Zhanzhao

1183
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,440
What else do you have to say?

1184
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,560
It was an error of judgment on my part

1185
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:42,359
I caused the death of Xiao Chengshou

1186
01:04:42,919 --> 01:04:43,280
I am...

1187
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,640
Willing to accept a penalty

1188
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,800
The most important thing at the
moment is the water and land puja

1189
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:51,600
Now that the remnants of the
Wolf Clan have been exterminated

1190
01:04:52,399 --> 01:04:53,399
This way

1191
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,239
Then put Zhan Zhao

1192
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:57,879
in the Kaifeng House prison first

1193
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,280
Waiting for the end of
the Water and Land Puja

1194
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Brother

1195
01:05:08,479 --> 01:05:09,479
Fourth Fifth

1196
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:09,919
Go

1197
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,280
Let's go

1198
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,040
You cannot leave

1199
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:14,760
Now that Zhan Zhao is behind bars

1200
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:15,800
for being wronged

1201
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:17,080
And so you go

1202
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:18,320
Who will help him?

1203
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,560
Miss Ding

1204
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:21,159
Please don't give us a hard time

1205
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:23,040
We really have no choice

1206
01:05:23,439 --> 01:05:25,399
That Mrs. Pang made
things difficult at every turn

1207
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:27,800
If we don't leave

1208
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,256
We'll have to go to the
prison with Zhanzhao too

1209
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,519
But if you don't save him

1210
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,679
He's really screwed

1211
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,760
Miss Ding, do you understand or not?

1212
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,410
Now Zhan Zhao is being punished

1213
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:38,800
There is no longer a name for the Royal Cat

1214
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,719
I have achieved my goal

1215
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,679
Why bother to save him?

1216
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:43,719
Brothers

1217
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:45,919
Let's go and ask Lord
Bao for his resignation

1218
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:47,560
Let's go

1219
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
Don't you go!

1220
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:49,679
Don't go

1221
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,239
You won't help, will you?

1222
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,600
Fine, I'll save him myself.

1223
01:06:16,479 --> 01:06:17,479
Guard Zhan

1224
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,240
Are you sure you don't want a bite?

1225
01:06:19,879 --> 01:06:20,879
Yes, Guard Zhan

1226
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:21,959
Have some

1227
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:27,639
Come

1228
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,840
What a stubborn man

1229
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,199
Two brothers

1230
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,239
Can you make an accommodation?

1231
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:48,239
Let me go to see Zhanzhao

1232
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:49,760
If you can take him away

1233
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:50,800
Hurry up

1234
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:52,199
Ok

1235
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,080
Come with me

1236
01:06:57,399 --> 01:06:58,399
Miss Ding

1237
01:06:58,439 --> 01:06:59,439
Don't waste your time

1238
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,040
I don't blame you for what
happened to my brother

1239
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,560
It won't help if you stay here

1240
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:08,479
Miss Ding

1241
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,600
You go

1242
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,959
I, Zhan, have solved many cases

1243
01:07:13,479 --> 01:07:14,879
I have never harmed anyone's life

1244
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,199
Stay here

1245
01:07:18,919 --> 01:07:20,399
is the last place I'll ever be

1246
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,840
I'll carry you away even if I have to today

1247
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Go

1248
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,280
Go

1249
01:07:25,439 --> 01:07:26,439
You go

1250
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:28,719
Let's go. Take you somewhere.

1251
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:40,959
You see

1252
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,800
Xiao Li has disappeared

1253
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,399
Where is my brother's body?

1254
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Fraudulent corpse

1255
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:49,719
Fraudulent corpse

1256
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,800
What a fraudulent corpse

1257
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,399
Brother, he went

1258
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,560
I see

1259
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,239
What's that, brother?

1260
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,879
Where is my brother's body?

1261
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,320
Your brother is not dead

1262
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,679
The day Xiao Li died to prove his innocence

1263
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:09,159
and you

1264
01:08:09,439 --> 01:08:10,679
were caught immediately after

1265
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,040
So

1266
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:14,056
I staged a play together The purpose
was to lure the snake out of the hole

1267
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,199
with Bai Yu Tang

1268
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,040
The purpose was

1269
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,720
to lure the snake out of the hole

1270
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:21,160
I'm glad Lord Bao is

1271
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,279
so clever.

1272
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,639
If not, how will Xiao Li

1273
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,359
be able to escape with peace of mind?

1274
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,840
What a way to lure a snake out of a hole

1275
01:08:28,879 --> 01:08:29,399
It seems that

1276
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,160
now if we find Xiao Li,

1277
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,439
everything will be clear.

1278
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,879
What do you mean brother?

1279
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,479
My brother is not dead

1280
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:37,399
yes

1281
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,319
then

1282
01:08:38,919 --> 01:08:40,319
So where are we going to find him?

1283
01:08:40,839 --> 01:08:41,839
This

1284
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,439
I guess the white mice had an arrangement

1285
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,240
I've put a Qie Li Yin on Xiao Li

1286
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,399
A man's stain will

1287
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:50,680
leave a mark for a thousand miles

1288
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,640
This one

1289
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,200
I admire

1290
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:57,958
You two don't fight anymore

1291
01:08:57,959 --> 01:08:58,959
yes

1292
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,040
The mouse and the cat working together

1293
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:02,479
will be invincible!

1294
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:41,799
Mr. Bao

1295
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,560
I heard that you judge people
by day and ghosts by night

1296
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,839
So you are the Emperor's subject after all

1297
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:47,720
or

1298
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,600
A minister of the gods!

1299
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,600
Where did the Master
get this nonsense from?

1300
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:54,959
I'm a mere mortal

1301
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,080
not that capable

1302
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,680
I'd like to hear more from Lord Bao

1303
01:09:59,919 --> 01:10:01,959
what is the hell of the underworld like?

1304
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,600
If the Master is curious

1305
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,359
you can go down and see for yourself

1306
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,120
I'm a coward

1307
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,759
I'd rather have Lord Bao
tell me after you have seen it

1308
01:10:26,879 --> 01:10:27,879
Emperor's order is here

1309
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,720
The Emperor's Decree

1310
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,240
The Emperor says

1311
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,680
God's Blessings

1312
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,240
The Emperor's Grace

1313
01:10:36,839 --> 01:10:39,000
King and the people of the various branches

1314
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,919
drink together from the Bian River

1315
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,359
King and the people of the various branches

1316
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:45,319
drink together from the Bian River

1317
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,799
over

1318
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,359
Thanks my king

1319
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,160
Lord Xiao

1320
01:11:27,839 --> 01:11:29,160
Show your true face!

1321
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:36,479
Brother

1322
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,560
So you're really from the Wolf Clan

1323
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:39,879
So what if you are

1324
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,320
Since you are in a hurry to come and die

1325
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:44,359
then don't blame me for being unkind to you

1326
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,120
Stop

1327
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:46,479
You won't make it.

1328
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,640
Stop?

1329
01:11:47,759 --> 01:11:48,759
Joke

1330
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,600
Kill

1331
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:43,520
Oh no!

1332
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,200
The river has been poisoned

1333
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,176
You must split up and
stop the water and land puja

1334
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Okay, let's go.

1335
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:55,279
Go

1336
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,080
It's time

1337
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,000
The King and the subjects
drinking water from the Bian River

1338
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,000
Don't drink it, don't
drink it, it's poisonous

1339
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,439
Don't Drink No

1340
01:14:33,759 --> 01:14:36,000
The water is poisoned. Don't drink it.

1341
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:39,759
Protect the Emperor, protect
the Emperor, have assassins.

1342
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,496
Don't drink. The water is
poisoned. The water is poisoned.

1343
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,760
Don't drink it. Don't drink it.

1344
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,040
Don't drink

1345
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,560
River water is poisonous

1346
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,759
The water is poisonous. Don't drink it.

1347
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,680
This water

1348
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,360
Emperor, the river water is
poisonous and cannot be drunk

1349
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,520
Xiao Li, let Miss Ding go!

1350
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,160
She is your sister

1351
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:13,359
So what

1352
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:14,999
Now that the time has passed

1353
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,096
The Great Plan of the Wolf
Clan has been accomplished

1354
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,120
Let Me Go

1355
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,560
Don't even think about it.

1356
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,120
Wait

1357
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:22,359
ok

1358
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
If you let Miss Ding go

1359
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,080
I can let you go

1360
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,160
Zhanzhao, don't mind me

1361
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:31,040
Must hang the Wolves

1362
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Miss Ding

1363
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:44,919
A little something

1364
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:52,559
Your Excellent Poison

1365
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,720
Enjoy yourself

1366
01:16:06,839 --> 01:16:07,839
yuehua

1367
01:16:07,879 --> 01:16:09,959
You must hold on. Hold on.

1368
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,120
Can you promise me one thing?

1369
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,680
Yes

1370
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,200
As long as you're well

1371
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,000
I can promise you anything

1372
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:23,640
Can you marry me?

1373
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,200
Yes

1374
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,080
When you're healed

1375
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:30,399
I will marry you

1376
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,640
I exchange my sword with you as proof

1377
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
Stupid Cat

1378
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:48,040
She doesn't die that easily

1379
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:49,439
Just obey him

1380
01:16:54,879 --> 01:16:55,879
Miss Ding

1381
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:57,399
yuehua

1382
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,680
This is how it happened

1383
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,375
It's a good thing the Emperor
didn't drink that bowl of water

1384
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:13,399
Emperor

1385
01:17:13,839 --> 01:17:15,959
today the wolves have been destroyed

1386
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,600
their chiefs

1387
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:19,799
Xiao Li has also been brought to justice

1388
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,080
Thanks to Guard Zhan

1389
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,560
And the Five Rats

1390
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,959
The Song Dynasty is full of talent

1391
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:34,399
I am very pleased

1392
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:38,720
1,000 taels of silver to Zhan Zhao

1393
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,439
Promoted to Second Grade Guard with Sword

1394
01:17:41,959 --> 01:17:43,839
Five rats are credited with protecting me

1395
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:46,679
appointing as a fourth-ranking
guard with a sword

1396
01:17:46,919 --> 01:17:49,399
to follow Lord Bao to protect our country

1397
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:51,919
Thanks my Emperor

1398
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Where is Bai Yu Tang?

1399
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,439
Why doesn't he come to see me?

1400
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:00,080
He's really got a lot of nerve

1401
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,240
This

1402
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,040
this

1403
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:04,399
this

1404
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:08,399
Bai Yu Tang is Sick

1405
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:09,720
Very Sick

1406
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,200
Can't even get out of bed

1407
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:12,919
Can't keep his eyes open

1408
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Can't breathe

1409
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:17,439
He's sick

1410
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:18,759
Yes, yes, yes

1411
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,720
Pity

1412
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,560
Pity

1413
01:18:23,879 --> 01:18:24,879
yuehua

1414
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:26,359
Look Over There

1415
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,760
This sword is returned to you

1416
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:35,399
What's wrong yuehua?

1417
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,680
You're all mine now

1418
01:18:37,799 --> 01:18:39,160
What do I need this sword for?

1419
01:18:39,759 --> 01:18:41,560
If you don't want it, give it to me

1420
01:18:42,959 --> 01:18:44,000
Nice try

1421
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:47,600
Go, I'll wait for you here.

1422
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:48,520
Ok

1423
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:49,879
I'll be right there then.

1424
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,040
Fine

1425
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:09,959
nice

1426
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,720
It's not stolen, is it?

1427
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:13,359
Bought

1428
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,880
Why not go to the palace to see the emperor

1429
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:21,479
I don't want to go,

1430
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:23,919
no rules

1431
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,040
how about

1432
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:33,319
Stay

1433
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:35,600
This is not the place for me

1434
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:38,319
OK

1435
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,839
This is really not the
right place for you to stay

1436
01:19:42,799 --> 01:19:43,799
Because

1437
01:19:44,799 --> 01:19:45,839
you're used to being loose

1438
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,560
But as long as you want to come back

1439
01:19:48,439 --> 01:19:50,080
My door is always open to you

1440
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:54,799
That's Nature

1441
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:56,958
Waiting for your wedding day

1442
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:57,959
I'll be back

1443
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:00,399
OK

1444
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,600
Then it's a deal

1445
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:17,799
Xiao Li is useless

1446
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,759
The job is not done

1447
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,359
Instead, let Zhan Zhao and
the others pick up the slack

1448
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:26,919
And collected the five
people from the trapped island

1449
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:30,359
miss

1450
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:31,599
In this way

1451
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,600
To be or not to be

1452
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,040
Not necessary

1453
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:36,080
Let them have their
fun for a couple of days

1454
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,879
How's that going?

1455
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:40,640
It's almost done

1456
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,799
Fake Bao is in place

1457
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,200
The real one

1458
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:45,935
Fell off a cliff after being
struck by three swords

1459
01:20:45,959 --> 01:20:48,479
Probably not going to survive

1460
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:49,759
That's good

1461
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,359
It was not in vain that I sacrificed

1462
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,520
a great general for more than 20 years

1463
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
so

1464
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,279
Our plan

1465
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,560
No Hindrance

1466
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,200
Proceed as usual

1467
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:04,560
This time the water and
land puja was lost though

1468
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,680
But still it is not too late

1469
01:21:07,759 --> 01:21:08,759
Yes

1470
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,439
Call to Order
