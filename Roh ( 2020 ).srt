1
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,291
Satan said, "I am better than him."

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,041
"You created me from fire
and created him from clay."

3
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:23,541
"Reprieve me until
the day they are resurrected."

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:30,541
Quran 7:12 & 14

5
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,666
Mom.

6
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,083
When can we slaughter another one, Mom?

7
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,500
Why don't you pick up the charcoal first?

8
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,958
It's still hot, Mom.

9
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,208
Can I choose which one for today?

10
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,166
You're such a...

11
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,875
Enough. Get Along.

12
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,458
Go check on the trap.

13
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,166
Can we?

14
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,375
Angah.

15
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,333
Along.

16
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,750
-Keep an eye on your brother.
-All right, Mom.

17
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,625
Along, this is enough for a week.

18
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,375
Don't speak of it.

19
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,458
Let's go.

20
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,583
Along!

21
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:54,750
Along!

22
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,375
Remember what Mom said.
Keep your head down.

23
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,333
Quick.

24
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,750
Mom!

25
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,375
Wait here.

26
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,666
Angah.

27
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,208
Didn't I tell you to
pick up the charcoal earlier?

28
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,708
Child, where are you from?

29
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,958
What's your name?

30
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,458
Little girl, I'll go fetch you some water.

31
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,500
She's probably from the village
across the river.

32
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,416
Got lost in the forest.

33
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,916
-I think...
-She's probably mute, Mom.

34
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,041
Mom, let me clean her up.

35
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:37,958
Right.

36
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,958
Let's bring her to the village
across the river.

37
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,250
Maybe the villagers know her.

38
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,083
What is it with you?

39
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,208
Mom.

40
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,416
This noon, at the trap,

41
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,208
we saw a deer.

42
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,166
Dead. Hung by a tree.

43
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,333
And then? What did you guys do?

44
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,333
I wanted to bring the deer home.

45
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,458
-Should last us a week.
-Are you crazy?

46
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,291
It was already dead, hanging by the tree.

47
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,541
A tiger might be lurking around.

48
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:04,416
Hey, don't just take
anything in the jungle.

49
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,208
Listen well.

50
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,208
Never believe everything
that you see or hear...

51
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,958
in the jungle.

52
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,208
If Dad was around, he would've...

53
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,250
And then?

54
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,041
Is he here right now?

55
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,041
Anyway, there are no tigers
in this jungle.

56
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,791
There are only crocodiles and lizards.

57
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,166
Mom, crocodiles and lizards
don't climb trees.

58
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,625
You're right.

59
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,416
Or it could be...

60
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,958
this is something else.

61
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,416
Something old people always talk about...

62
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,791
related to deer.

63
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,041
They say...

64
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,791
it likes to roam around the jungle...

65
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,208
with its ghostly dogs.

66
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,541
Whoever sees it...

67
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,791
will fall ill...

68
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,375
or die.

69
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,500
What is this "something," Mom?

70
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,250
It swore a solemn oath
not to return home...

71
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,500
until it gets what it wants.

72
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,791
Day and night.

73
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,500
it hunted...

74
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,416
slaying innumerable creatures...

75
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,125
especially...

76
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:03,750
deer...

77
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,791
and children.

78
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,958
It throws away the unfavorable ones.

79
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,083
Until one day...

80
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,625
the jungle put a spell on It.

81
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,458
So, it became
a regular denizen of the jungle...

82
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,541
or some people called it...

83
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,166
the ghost hunter.

84
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,875
It eats flesh...

85
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,500
and drinks blood.

86
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,625
Until now...

87
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,625
it's still hunting.

88
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,750
So, the deer might be...

89
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,916
When you hear dogs barking...

90
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,458
or the sound of nightjars...

91
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,958
flying in a flock at night...

92
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,416
you'll know that it's nearby.

93
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,416
So when it's nearby...

94
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,541
pick up...

95
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,250
two stones...

96
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,833
and knock them together
while calling out...

97
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,666
"Grandpa, bring us their hearts."

98
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,083
"Grandpa, bring us their hearts."

99
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,708
Why must we say that, Mom?

100
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,750
You must play its game...

101
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,916
asking for what it has hunted...

102
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,166
so that it believes that
you are its follower.

103
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,458
Mom.

104
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,750
How do the nightjars sound like?

105
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,625
How?

106
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:46,958
So...

107
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,083
the deer...

108
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,500
It means it's nearby?

109
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,125
It's simple.

110
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,375
Find two stones and then...

111
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,958
It's here.

112
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,166
Mom!

113
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,750
When the moon turns full...

114
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,625
all of you will die.

115
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,625
What do we do now, Mom?

116
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,666
Excuse me.

117
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,583
I was just passing by.

118
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,250
Look.

119
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,625
These stones look strange.

120
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,833
That's why I stopped by to take a look.

121
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,791
I have no idea.

122
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,708
They fell down last night.

123
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,375
Where are you from?

124
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,583
I'm from the other side of the river.

125
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,166
I come here to collect plants
in the swamp.

126
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,333
I hope you don't mind.

127
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,041
We don't mind at all.

128
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,375
You should inform your husband too.

129
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,958
It's just the three of us.

130
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,750
You can call me Tok.

131
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,291
I hope you won't mind
what I'm about to tell you.

132
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,500
I know a few things.

133
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,083
Look.

134
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,500
These stones are bad omens.

135
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,541
They often mean that
bad things will happen soon.

136
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,500
-I think...
-Stay for a while.

137
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,458
Have some coffee...

138
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,041
or tea?

139
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,208
Nevermind.

140
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,208
I must go.

141
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,750
Maybe next time.

142
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,625
Why don't the two of you...

143
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,333
go pick these stones

144
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,583
and throw them away?

145
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,000
Come on. Go.

146
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,208
I have some advice.

147
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,958
If there's anything amiss...

148
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,041
Anything...

149
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,625
Come look for me.

150
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,750
I live on that hill.

151
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,375
Along.

152
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,250
The full moon is due
in a couple of days, right?

153
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,458
Yes. Why?

154
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,708
Why?

155
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,125
Didn't you hear what
the little girl said just now?

156
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
That's nonsense.

157
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,583
Who knows what happened to her
when she was lost in the jungle.

158
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,500
I shouldn't have greeted her that day.

159
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,791
It wasn't that.

160
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,083
Along.

161
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,458
Last night, I think I saw...

162
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,625
What happened to that girl
wasn't our fault.

163
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,708
So, keep in mind,
don't mention this to anyone.

164
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:45,916
Along?

165
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,416
Mom, where are you going?

166
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,583
Along's fever is too high.
I will look for Tok.

167
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:38,750
Along?

168
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:04,750
We live too far to ask for
the help of others.

169
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,500
We need to ward off her misfortune.

170
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,333
It might be just a disease but who knows?

171
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,291
Things like this can't be taken lightly.

172
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:35,250
Something evil has entered this area.

173
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,333
Go home and take a look at your daughter.

174
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,166
Take this.

175
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,833
Throw it far away into the water.

176
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,166
And these doves...

177
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,166
Do as I've told you.

178
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:55,541
Understand?

179
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,291
You don't have to stay on that hill.

180
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,708
Don't worry.

181
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,541
I'm used to it already.

182
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,625
We don't have guests that often.

183
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,625
It'll be nice to have
another adult around as company.

184
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,291
I only have these kids.

185
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:06,875
What a pain in the neck.

186
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,166
Do you miss Dad?

187
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,250
Do you think Dad will ever come back?

188
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,125
I don't know.

189
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,833
I just hope he comes back soon.

190
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,250
Me too.

191
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:33,750
If Dad was around...

192
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,333
Mom wouldn't be as cranky as she is now.

193
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,291
Listen here.

194
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,875
I have some advice to give you.

195
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,541
Hey, it's okay.

196
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,666
It's late.

197
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,083
I must go.

198
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,500
All right.

199
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,833
When you feel like visiting,
just stop by anytime.

200
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,958
Grandpa, bring us their hearts.

201
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,708
Grandpa, bring us their hearts.

202
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:42,416
Grandpa, bring us their hearts.

203
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:47,833
Grandpa, bring us their hearts.

204
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,416
Have you seen a girl?

205
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,500
About his height.

206
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,708
No, we didn't.

207
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:43,791
Are you sure?

208
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:46,875
No one has come by.

209
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,416
Try looking around in the village
across the river.

210
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:54,666
I came...

211
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:56,500
from there.

212
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,625
There's no other kid except my children.

213
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:02,916
Look somewhere else!

214
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,500
Mom.

215
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:55,083
Don't you think that guy
looks like a hunter?

216
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,375
He even has a spear.

217
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,500
He looks like he just returned from war.

218
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,875
Filthy. Ill-mannered.

219
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,333
Something isn't right about that stranger.

220
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,833
What do you mean?

221
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,583
Exactly. Why was he looking for the girl?

222
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,916
That's why.

223
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,750
Perhaps the girl was
running away from him.

224
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:18,666
Who knows?

225
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,208
I was only asking.

226
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,125
He might be her father.

227
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,000
Many strange things have happened
since the girl's arrival.

228
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:45,708
And now...

229
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,541
this stranger.

230
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,791
Maybe he's the cause.

231
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:06,291
We're now living in a dangerous time.

232
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,833
Many people are desperate...

233
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,291
and feel unsafe.

234
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:15,500
Angah!

235
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:29,958
Angah!

236
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:38,666
Angah!

237
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:54,666
Along?

238
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:55,958
Along?

239
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:57,875
Along!

240
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,583
Along!

241
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,000
Along!

242
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,250
Along!

243
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:07,083
What happened to Along?

244
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:11,083
Along went missing.

245
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,375
She wasn't there
when we woke up this morning.

246
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,833
I can sense that
there's a stranger around here.

247
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,541
-A man?
-Yes.

248
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,833
He stopped by our house yesterday.

249
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,083
Why?

250
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,458
What did he want?

251
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:31,541
He asked whether we'd seen a little girl.

252
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,333
A little girl?

253
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,500
So have you seen her?

254
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,708
Along fell ill yesterday...

255
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,708
and she went missing today.

256
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,208
I think it's related to him.

257
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:48,875
I'm not sure.

258
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:50,708
I'm going there.

259
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,458
I'll try to look for Along along the way.

260
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,166
Along?

261
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:52,958
Where did you go?

262
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,000
What happened to you?

263
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,833
I found her in the jungle.

264
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,708
Fool! Don't try to fool me!
What have you done to my daughter?

265
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:03,708
-I'll slit your throat with this machete!
-Ask her yourself!

266
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:14,250
Where did you get this dagger?

267
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,333
So it's true that
the little girl was here.

268
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,958
-I told you there was no one here.
-Don't you dare lie to me!

269
00:49:25,708 --> 00:49:26,791
Yes, she was here.

270
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:27,708
Along!

271
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,166
She followed us home.

272
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:31,083
Mom took her in.

273
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,708
Mom gave her food.

274
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:35,208
-Along!
-Mister.

275
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:36,833
Let me take you...

276
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:38,916
to where she is.

277
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,708
-Please leave my family alone.
-Shut up, Angah!

278
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,708
This boy will take me to her.

279
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:50,333
After seeing the little girl,
I'll leave this place.

280
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:52,333
It's okay, Mom.

281
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:54,041
I'm here.

282
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,416
Let Angah take him to her.

283
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,750
Along.

284
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:41,916
Many things had happened.

285
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:43,833
We didn't know what to do.

286
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,708
There's an open field...

287
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,500
with a big, dead tree in the middle.

288
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:16,583
She's there.

289
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,291
Are you sure it wasn't him?

290
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,875
Let's just leave this place.

291
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:57,750
Where?

292
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,583
To the village across the river?

293
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,708
It'll take us a day to get there.

294
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:03,375
With your condition like this?

295
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,291
What condition should I be...

296
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:08,833
before we can leave, Mom?

297
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:11,250
We must bring the charcoal with us, Along.

298
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:13,166
You know that too.

299
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,500
We have nothing.

300
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:19,625
Tell me, Mom.

301
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:24,375
When was the last time
you prostrated and asked for help?

302
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,208
Are you still expecting your dead husband

303
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:29,625
to return and help?

304
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,083
Or...

305
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,125
are you waiting for me
to prostrate for you, you fool?

306
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:42,958
Why don't you just die,
you useless mother!

307
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:23,916
Tok.

308
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,041
Did you find your sister?

309
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,583
Be patient, child.

310
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,125
We all belong to Him.

311
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:01,833
Tok.

312
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:04,875
There's something wrong around here.

313
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:07,541
Something that we can't see...

314
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:08,958
and it's evil!

315
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:14,958
There is always something evil around us.

316
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:17,250
You don't have to be afraid.

317
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:21,541
The things that you can't see or hold...

318
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:24,000
have no power over you.

319
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:28,958
It can only hurt you through humans.

320
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,125
The stranger...

321
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,250
So, remember.

322
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,375
Don't trust others too much.

323
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:57,958
Run!

324
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:09,250
So it's true that you saw
that little girl.

325
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,750
Where is the body?

326
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,791
We left it in an open field.

327
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,708
Hopefully, someone else sees it.

328
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,750
I don't want my kids to...

329
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,375
Angah already showed the stranger
where the body was.

330
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:36,416
He was the one who found Along.

331
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:38,083
We should help him in return.

332
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:39,000
Help?

333
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,291
Did he say where he came from?

334
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:42,458
Did he?

335
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,916
He said he came from
the village across the river.

336
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,916
Do you know what happened in that village?

337
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
What?

338
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,625
All the houses were burnt down
to the ground.

339
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,500
There's nothing left.

340
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:57,166
What happened, exactly?

341
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,666
Why did the little girl run away?

342
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:01,958
The little girl didn't run away.

343
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,041
You should already know by now

344
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,541
that she's not an ordinary child.

345
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:10,458
So who's that stranger?

346
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,250
What should we do?

347
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,791
Things are getting complicated.

348
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:33,833
Humans thrive and perish
along with nature.

349
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:41,250
And now the stranger has the body back.

350
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,333
We can never know what will happen next.

351
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:10,833
Mom!

352
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,416
Help me.

353
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,958
I need to ask for something.

354
01:04:58,875 --> 01:04:59,958
Angah?

355
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:02,041
Have you packed the charcoal?

356
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,125
Just take what we have.

357
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:06,208
There's still a bit more.

358
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,083
Hurry up, we don't have much time, Angah!

359
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:11,500
I'm hungry.

360
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,250
Can we eat first?

361
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:16,458
Go now and do as I said!

362
01:06:12,916 --> 01:06:13,750
Angah?

363
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,875
Angah?

364
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:20,916
Angah?

365
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:23,583
Angah!

366
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,166
Angah?

367
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,166
Angah!

368
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,166
You said you would leave this place.

369
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:40,125
You found the little girl.

370
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,083
What are you still doing here?

371
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,250
I'm here to look for your son.

372
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:46,041
What do you want from my son?

373
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,125
Who are you, exactly?

374
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,583
Please don't get me wrong.

375
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:50,875
Don't you dare lie to me.

376
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,333
We don't have much time.

377
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:55,541
Things will worsen.

378
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,541
Worsen?

379
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,375
What's worse than...

380
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:00,791
having my dead daughter's body
in the house...

381
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:02,625
while having my son go missing?

382
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,458
Listen here!

383
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:09,125
You must believe me
if you want to stay safe.

384
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:10,041
Or else...

385
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,791
Or else what?

386
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,208
Please believe me.

387
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,958
Didn't I find your lost daughter
in the jungle?

388
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,208
Was it really you who found her?

389
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,041
Don't you lie to her!

390
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,458
You must leave this place.

391
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,625
Don't believe...

392
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:32,958
Why don't you leave this place peacefully?

393
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,333
This woman!

394
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,916
You should leave now
if you want to be safe.

395
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:42,791
Fine.

396
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,708
I'll find your son myself.

397
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,333
I think...

398
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,750
you need this spear more than I do.

399
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:10,916
I don't understand.

400
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:13,916
Don't go.

401
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,416
You can't fight him.

402
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,541
You'd better wait here.

403
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,708
Believe me.

404
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,875
I must find Angah before he does.

405
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,708
Let me do it instead.

406
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,208
Look after your daughter.

407
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:31,375
We don't know what he's done
to the girl's body.

408
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:41,458
It's better if I kill him.

409
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,458
Wait here.

410
01:14:00,125 --> 01:14:01,958
I've killed the boy.

411
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:06,625
You were willing to sacrifice his life.

412
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,791
Did you take a good look at his face...

413
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:11,750
while you killed him?

414
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:13,416
Didn't you pity him?

415
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,166
He was possessed.

416
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:19,458
I couldn't save him.

417
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,083
The same as my daughter.

418
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,916
She's done her part.

419
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:32,666
This body is for the next child.

420
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,541
It's the child's turn now.

421
01:14:36,833 --> 01:14:38,583
Let me ask you again.

422
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,875
What did you really see...

423
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,083
while you slit his throat?

424
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:02,375
It's easy to fool humans.

425
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,458
You were given so many signs.

426
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:15,416
You could've saved that family.

427
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:20,583
But all you thought about
was your daughter.

428
01:16:22,083 --> 01:16:23,458
You were selfish.

429
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,291
So, why must I prostrate...

430
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:40,291
to humans like you?

431
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:45,916
"Humans"?

432
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:48,958
What do you mean?

433
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,083
Who are you, exactly?

434
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:07,083
You don't need to know who we are.

435
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,583
"We"?

436
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,500
It was you!

437
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,416
You deceived me with your tricks!

438
01:17:47,458 --> 01:17:49,833
All we need to do is whisper.

439
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:57,166
And you obeyed our whispers.

440
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,583
You're more powerful!

441
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:09,000
You know that we have no power over you...

442
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:14,500
unless it's His will.

443
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:27,541
What else will you do to my daughter?

444
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:32,291
This is just a body...

445
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:36,791
that will rot and become clay.

446
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,666
Endless revenge!

447
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:45,500
You're willing to damn yourself
because of clay!

448
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:48,791
Your time has passed.

449
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:55,791
Don't regret the past, for it is over...

450
01:18:57,916 --> 01:19:01,458
or be intoxicated with
the ephemeral present.

451
01:19:03,666 --> 01:19:07,666
Ephemerality belongs to us.

452
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:18,000
But the next life...

453
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,416
will be as eternal...

454
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,958
as your soul.

455
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:37,250
Where do you think your soul will go?

456
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:47,541
Will your soul...

457
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:53,125
rise like fire that reaches the heavens...

458
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,416
or will your soul

459
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:03,083
fall like ashes
that scatter over the ground?
