1
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,786
Oh...

2
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:38,623
Oh...

3
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,959
Come on, come on,
go, go, go, go!

4
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,588
- Come on, we're coming through.
- Go, go. Come on.
- You'll be okay.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,923
You'll be alright.
You're gonna be fine.

6
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,675
Thank you, Stubby.

7
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,554
- Well done, boy.
- Good boy.

8
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,765
He saved him again.

9
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,266
That's a good dog.

10
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:38,141
Get out of here,
you stinkin' mutt!

11
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,478
Go rifle through
someone else's trash.

12
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:46,316
Go!

13
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,615
Ah! Watch it, mutt.

14
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,368
- Hey!
- Come on!

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,912
Whose dog is that?!

16
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:38,660
- Take care!
- We're proud of you!

17
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:49,296
When my brother put on the
uniform of the United States Army,

18
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:51,506
I was so very proud.

19
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:56,303
In 1917, our country went
to war with Germany.

20
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:57,846
All across the nation,

21
00:02:58,138 --> 00:03:01,183
thousands of young men
answered the call to fight.

22
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,684
They were just boys.

23
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:05,228
Well,
they were called Doughboys,

24
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,857
and my brother Robert
was one of them.

25
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,944
By the time we joined the war
in April 1917,

26
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:17,365
the French and British
had already been fighting
the mighty German Army

27
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:19,284
for three long years.

28
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:21,119
Their spirits were low.

29
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:24,956
But they were happy to know
that we were coming to help.

30
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,376
This is the true story
of a special friendship

31
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:32,172
my brother made
while training for the war.

32
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,103
Oh, no, you don't.

33
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:49,981
Scram, mutt!

34
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,524
Scram!

35
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:57,072
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

36
00:03:57,364 --> 00:03:59,241
Platoon... halt!

37
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,993
Left... face!

38
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,578
At ease!

39
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,292
No time for lip spittle, boys.

40
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:13,129
We have four short weeks left
to turn you into soldiers.

41
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,092
You've worked hard on drill,
learned teamwork,

42
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:18,677
discipline.
But...

43
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,762
next is the crump-hole.

44
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:24,224
That's why you and I are here.

45
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,317
Wha...?!
How did this dog get in here?!

46
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,070
Get out! Get out of here!

47
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,030
Hey!!

48
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,365
Ah!

49
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,411
Hey, shhh, shhh.

50
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,831
Get off of me. Come on, go.
I don't have any more food.
Go away. Shoo.

51
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:49,958
Come on,
you're gonna get me in trouble.
Get off.

52
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,295
- Now General Pershing's
gonna change all that.
- Go.

53
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:55,297
Shoo. Shoo.

54
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,924
Go. Get away.

55
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,803
When we get there,

56
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:05,307
we're gonna take the fight
to the enemy.

57
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,894
At least he's ready.

58
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:15,233
This pooch belong
to any of you men?

59
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,158
I see you eyeballing him,
Private Conroy.

60
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,702
Better fetch that dog a bone.

61
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,954
Looks like he could use it.

62
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,916
Platoon, atten...tion!

63
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,713
Dismissed.

64
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:40,383
Alright. Come on, boy,
you heard the sergeant.
Let's go.

65
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,888
And that's how Robert
met his new little buddy.

66
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,351
Come on, move along.
This is not a picnic.

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,272
Oh, it's that mutt again.

68
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:58,318
- Sergeant says get him fed.
- Uh, I don't cook for dogs.

69
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,654
Hey, Biscuit,
he might be the only one
that likes your cooking.

70
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,323
Better be nice to him.

71
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,537
You really know
how to make friends,
don't you, Olsen?

72
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,915
Sure do. Always.

73
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,626
You, uh, find a new buddy,
Conroy?

74
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,128
No, actually,
he kinda found me.

75
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,963
Isn't that right, boy?

76
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:21,299
Can't believe
the sergeant let the dog stay.

77
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,968
- He must feel sorry for us.
- Alright, alright.

78
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,263
The sergeant gave him a pass,
but the colonel never will.

79
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,140
Maybe the sergeant
wanted a mascot,

80
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,184
to give the unit
a different look.

81
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,479
Ugh. A different smell, too.
Hey, no, wait!

82
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:37,357
What the...? No! Bad dog!
Bad dog!

83
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:40,235
I hate dogs.

84
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,796
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey, listen.

85
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,090
Listen. Stay.

86
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,467
No. St...

87
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,219
Stay.

88
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,470
Good.

89
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,391
You sleep there, on the floor,
not in my bed.

90
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,685
Good.

91
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,479
Good night, boy.

92
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,458
That's enough shuteye!
On your feet! Out of the sack!

93
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:44,757
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

94
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,469
Column left... march!

95
00:07:56,352 --> 00:08:00,982
Left! Left! Left, right, left!
Left! Left! Left, right, left!

96
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,151
Left! Left!

97
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:06,821
Go! Go! Go!

98
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,535
Over the wall, Clayborn,
not through it!

99
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,537
I got it.

100
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,206
Oh!

101
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:28,676
Whose target is that?

102
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,887
Hey, boy, go fetch it.

103
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,849
He's quite a dog you got there,
Conroy.

104
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,852
Not even afraid
of the sound of gunfire.

105
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,400
Well done, soldier.

106
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,903
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Not you.

107
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:49,489
You missed the target
completely.

108
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,158
I was talking to the dog.

109
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,371
Pick up your feet, Olsen!
One after the other!

110
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:01,793
Ow. Oh.

111
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:05,421
Back of the line, Conroy.
Do it again.

112
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,557
Put your glasses on, Schroeder!
The enemy's that way!

113
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:25,525
I loved hearing
how his little dog

114
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,986
trained right alongside Robert
and his buddies.

115
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:29,612
Platoon... halt!

116
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,615
Robert's letters
were full of his exploits.

117
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:38,162
It made me happy to know
how much joy the dog brought
to my kid brother.

118
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,707
At ease.

119
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,835
Look at him.

120
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:45,920
He has been training
alongside you guys

121
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:48,548
and he drills better
than most of you.

122
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:53,428
You could all learn something
from him.

123
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:08,860
I hope you'll be able
to keep him, Conroy.

124
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:13,114
This is the army, Schroeder.
If they don't issue it,
you don't need it.

125
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,991
That includes pets.

126
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:16,868
All the same, I'm keeping him.

127
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,622
In fact,
I thought of a name for him:
Stubby.

128
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,210
It's a perfect name
for a perfect little tail.

129
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,546
Ain't that right?
Yeah, right, Stubby?

130
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,590
Whoa. One thing's for certain.

131
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:35,011
When the colonel catches him,
it's bye-bye, doggie.

132
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,220
Hmm.

133
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,431
Maybe not.

134
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,433
Alright, bud.

135
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,728
Listen to me, listen.
Alright, stay calm.

136
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,606
Stay... No, listen. Sit. Sit.

137
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,149
Stubby, come on.

138
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,653
We're gonna stay here all night
until we get this right.

139
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:54,530
Hold it... hold it.

140
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,949
Hold... it.

141
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,921
♪ Over there over there

142
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:13,675
♪ Send the word
send the word over there ♪

143
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,969
That's you, men.
You're the Yankee Division.

144
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,806
That includes you too, Stubby.

145
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,226
What in Sam Hill
is that dog doing here?

146
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,395
Platoon, attention!

147
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:29,941
This is an army base,
not a petting zoo!
Whose dog is this?!

148
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,403
Yes, he's my dog,
Colonel, sir.

149
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,160
What in tarnation?

150
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:43,454
Did you train this dog, soldier?

151
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,582
Yes, sir.
Wasn't that hard, sir.

152
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,878
Next thing you know,
he'll be barking out
general orders.

153
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,715
Uh, sir, what would you have
us do with the dog?

154
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,801
Well, as long as that dog
soldiers like that,

155
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:01,222
he's as welcome
as any man in this army.
Carry on, men.

156
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,479
You're something else, Stubby.

157
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,102
Remove your gas masks. Do it!

158
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,979
Do it now!

159
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,826
Outside! Now!

160
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,124
This is teargas, men,

161
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,086
not the mustard or poisonous gas
you will be facing.

162
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,255
Keep your masks handy
at all times.

163
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,217
Get used to them,
learn to live in them.

164
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:51,917
Alright, Stubs, here we go.

165
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:53,502
Whew! Oh!

166
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,717
Oh! Okay, Stubby,
you're too quick for me, boy.

167
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,095
Left! Left!

168
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,138
Left, right, left!

169
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,266
To the rear! March!

170
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:09,184
Left! Left!

171
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:11,395
Left, right, left!

172
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,647
Left! Left!

173
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:16,275
Left, right, left!

174
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,569
Platoon... halt!

175
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:21,822
Left... face! At ease.

176
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,448
Well done, gentlemen.

177
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,534
You've come a long way.

178
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,036
You too, Stubby.

179
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:33,667
Yep, that's right,
it's chow time, boy.

180
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,086
Hey, Stubby,
look what I got for you.

181
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:39,339
Hey, Biscuit, can we get
something other than dog food?

182
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:42,217
I'm not talking to you, Olsen.
I'm talking to Stubby.

183
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:43,969
How'd you end up here,
Schroeder?

184
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,762
Yeah, you're a German,
ain't you?

185
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,474
If a German doesn't join,
he's a slacker.

186
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,476
- A what?
- A draft dodger.

187
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,312
That's why you joined?

188
00:14:53,604 --> 00:14:56,481
Do you see how people
look at Germans these days?

189
00:14:56,773 --> 00:14:59,651
If I didn't join, I couldn't
call myself an American.

190
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:04,156
Hey, you know what, Schroeder?
You're an American in my book.

191
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,368
I've watched you men
become soldiers.

192
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,370
It makes me proud.

193
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:14,708
You, too, Stubby.
I hope you stay on the base
to look after the next group.

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,420
Now, take this weekend to write
your letters and say your farewells.

195
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:22,424
And pray that we will all be home
safe and sound very soon.

196
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:24,259
We ship out on Monday night.

197
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:25,969
God bless us all,

198
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:29,556
and God bless
the United States of America.

199
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:32,017
Take charge of your men,
Sergeant.

200
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:37,856
Dismissed!

201
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:49,952
Robert told me how scared
he and the other boys were

202
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:54,623
when they finally got word
it was time to go to war.

203
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:59,670
I didn't receive Robert's
last letter from camp

204
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:01,797
until he had set sail
for France.

205
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,591
He wrote me how
about he would miss me,

206
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:07,803
but mainly
how heartbroken he was

207
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:11,682
at having
to leave Stubby behind.

208
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:14,309
Not right now, Stubby.

209
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,356
I was just so worried,

210
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:22,025
and I prayed
he'd be home again soon.

211
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,906
Stubby, come on.

212
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,574
This is really hard for me, too.

213
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:33,954
You're going to be fine and I will
be back before you know it.

214
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:38,750
Look. I got a gift for you.

215
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,938
Hold it, Stubby, hold it!

216
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,860
Look at you, handsome boy!
Looking good, Stubby!

217
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:10,407
Come now.

218
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:20,167
Like I promised,
he'll be here for you
when you get back.

219
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,378
I'll take good care of him.

220
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:27,132
You hear that, Stubby?
You'll never be hungry.

221
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:58,914
Stay, Stubby.

222
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:01,166
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

223
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,585
Conroy, get in line.
Let's go.

224
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:40,247
Stubby! Where you going?!

225
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:08,001
Up, up, up, up, up.

226
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:11,755
Bring that up. Hey.
Hey, watch your head over there.

227
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:15,008
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

228
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:17,881
Oh!

229
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,549
Stubby?

230
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,927
How did you get here?
Where did you come from?
How did you get here?

231
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,055
What are we going to do
with you?

232
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:27,057
We'll have to hide you.

233
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,433
Somehow.

234
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,310
Oh, brother, it's the mutt.

235
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:32,270
How did he get here?

236
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:34,689
I don't know. It's a miracle.

237
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:38,610
Stubby, you're just so clever,
aren't you?

238
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,781
This is a really dumb idea.

239
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,033
Shhh, Stubby.

240
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,744
Shhh.
We can't let them hear you.

241
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:51,289
When they find him,
they're gonna throw him
overboard.

242
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,588
Who in the...?! What...?

243
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,548
What the...?

244
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,802
What the devil
is going on here?!

245
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:15,063
Ahem-hem. Better salute, sir.

246
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,857
Someone's got
a lot of explaining to do.

247
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,110
Who smuggled this dog aboard?

248
00:23:20,402 --> 00:23:22,487
He followed me on the train,
sir!

249
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:23,905
He was quite determined.

250
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:26,408
But I swear I did not carry him
on board, sir.

251
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:30,412
He sort of became the regiment's
unofficial mascot, sir.

252
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:36,876
I didn't carry him on board,
either, sir.

253
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:42,590
You're quite resourceful,
aren't you, boy?

254
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,218
Why, thank you, fella.

255
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,803
Well, I guess it's better

256
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:50,515
to have every man and every dog
we can get in this fight.

257
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:55,145
Make sure he receives some...
dog tags. Carry on.

258
00:23:57,147 --> 00:24:01,651
Mother! How does he keep
getting away with this?!

259
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:13,538
There ya go, Stubby.
You're a real Yankee now.

260
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:20,420
Every day,
we scanned the newspapers
for news of the Minnesota.

261
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:24,340
They were full of stories about
our boys being lost at sea,

262
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,551
but nothing
about the Yankee Division.

263
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:30,805
I had no idea that Stubby
had made it onboard.

264
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,067
It was two long months
before I got word

265
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,821
that Robert and Stubby
were safely in France...

266
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:49,449
...when I heard
they were headed into action

267
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:52,035
at a place
called Chemin des Dames,

268
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:55,580
where they were going
to join the French lines.

269
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,690
The Americans.

270
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:38,373
Mother,
they look like they've been
through the wringer.

271
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,084
That's why we're here,
I guess.

272
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,044
Shhh!

273
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:31,759
Evidently,
Stubby wasted no time
in making himself useful.

274
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:35,888
He began by clearing
the vermin from the trenches.

275
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:43,104
I'm hungry.

276
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:45,773
Somebody tell me
there's breakfast.

277
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:02,040
Incoming! Take cover!

278
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,293
Get down. Get down!

279
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,253
- Hey, get down!
- Oh!

280
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:10,632
Medic!

281
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,301
- Medic!
- Keep down!

282
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,973
Attention!

283
00:27:29,776 --> 00:27:31,903
From his first day in action,

284
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:34,197
Stubby was on a mission.

285
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:36,449
Medic!!

286
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:40,495
And he dug out many soldiers
who'd been buried.

287
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:44,707
Robert was so proud of him.

288
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:51,422
- Injured man coming through!
- To your positions!
You must hold them!

289
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:55,343
Stay on the wall
and watch for an attack!

290
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,223
Come, Sergeant, look.

291
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:04,686
I'll be darned.

292
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:10,525
Okay, but we must not let down
our guard.

293
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:15,405
This time,
it was only a little welcome
from our Boche friends.

294
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:21,202
Move along, Yanks, move along.

295
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:24,163
You cannot save us
if you hang around in here.

296
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,082
Come on. Next.

297
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:28,459
I don't think they like us.

298
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:30,461
I thought "Yankee"
was a good word.

299
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:33,047
Excuse me, uh,
something for my dog, please.

300
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,007
For your dog?

301
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,135
Are you crazy, Yankee?

302
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:40,555
He is a soldier.
He's the division mascot.

303
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:43,433
Name's Stubby.
You see his dog tags?

304
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,102
And now a Boche is telling me

305
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:49,355
to give good French food
to an American dog?

306
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,108
Ah, this war is getting crazier
every day.

307
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,193
I am an American.

308
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,863
Oh, ja, ja.
Of course you are.

309
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,656
Yeah.

310
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:01,534
He is American!
Do you understand?

311
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:04,078
Well, he sounds like a Boche
to me.

312
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,164
And you sound like a moron,
froggy!

313
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,499
- Quoi?!
- Ow!

314
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,252
Enough, you two.

315
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:14,005
We are here to fight the Boche,
not each other.

316
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:16,048
Allez.

317
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,675
Un bisou.

318
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:23,097
Now, zat's better.

319
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:25,892
We are all friend now. Uh?

320
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:27,935
Stubby, shhh.
Calm down. Calm down.

321
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,312
Come here.
Calm down, Stubby.

322
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:33,107
American soldier.
You must be Conroy, no?

323
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,443
Yes. I'm-I'm Conroy.

324
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:38,905
I am Gaston Baptiste
of the Third Regiment,

325
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:40,823
and we are to be
working together.

326
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:44,786
My Capitaine says,
"Look for a man
with a little dog."

327
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,370
Hmm. Really?

328
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,707
Yes, you and me and your,
uh, little... friend...

329
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:54,170
...you will get so close
to the Boche,

330
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,631
you will be able to smell them.

331
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:07,600
- Ah!
- Have you ever used
one of these?

332
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,143
Hmm?

333
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:12,146
Um, y-yeah.
Yeah, in basic training.

334
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,609
It's also perfect for cheese.

335
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,111
Want to try some?

336
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:23,658
I must apologize for this slop
that cook calls food.

337
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:27,703
- It's war. I understand
- No, there is no excuse!

338
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:32,208
Napoleon say an army marches
on its stomach,

339
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:36,546
so they should give ours
with good food.

340
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,965
Voila.

341
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:42,718
Um... so what exactly
are we going to be doing?

342
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,137
Can you ride a horse? No?

343
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,140
Yes, yes. I-I mean, I'm...
I might not be the best,

344
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,142
but you know, I-I'm okay.

345
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,478
Good, because our officers
have decided

346
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,857
that we will be spying
on the Boche.

347
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:59,235
- Hmm?
- You, me and, uh...

348
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:01,737
- Salty.
- Actually, it's Stubby

349
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,491
Okay.
But first, let's celebrate.

350
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,203
Uh... no.

351
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:11,038
No, mais it's only wine.

352
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,249
You don't like wine,
American soldier?

353
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,918
I never drank wine,

354
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,588
and I'm sure
it's against the rules for us.

355
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,298
The rules? What rules?

356
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,550
This is war.

357
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:27,221
Ah. Without wine,

358
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:30,766
we French
would not have survived
these three years,

359
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,435
so they give it to us.

360
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,770
The French army
gives you wine?

361
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,606
Bien sûr, mon ami!

362
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:41,235
We French go from the milk of our
mothers to the juice of the vine.

363
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,446
Hey, you hear that, Stubby?

364
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:46,657
- They get wine.
- Eh, okay, let's go.

365
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,831
Hey, Conroy, Conroy.
What's happening?

366
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:57,835
Uh, apparently,
I have to follow him

367
00:31:58,127 --> 00:31:59,378
Eh. Lucky you.

368
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,173
And you two, come with me.

369
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:20,399
This is horrible.

370
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,319
Everything's destroyed.

371
00:32:24,153 --> 00:32:25,488
Everything.

372
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,324
No, not everything

373
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:34,080
Stubby, down!

374
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,211
Come, my friends.

375
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:41,963
Those are ours.

376
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,256
We pay them back
for this morning.

377
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,717
I thought
we were being attacked.

378
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,220
You will soon know
the difference

379
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:51,806
between theirs and ours.

380
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,199
Et voilà.

381
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,077
Here it is, your new home.

382
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,497
Sweet dreams.

383
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,960
Get up now, everybody!

384
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,045
Everybody, get up!

385
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:25,589
Come on, Conroy.

386
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:32,555
Now let me sleep Stubby,
just let me sleep a little more.

387
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,473
Woof-woof.

388
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:37,935
Oh. Oh! Ah! Ah. Sorry.

389
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,521
- Alright, get up now.
- Yeah, I'm up, I'm up.

390
00:33:40,813 --> 00:33:42,356
I'm up. I'm getting up.

391
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,500
Uh... have you done this before?

392
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:06,338
Don't worry, it will be fine.
I've done this many times.

393
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,257
Where did you find him?

394
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,968
Oh, uh, he was living rough.

395
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,220
He joined us
when we were training.

396
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,306
He's not very beautiful.

397
00:34:15,598 --> 00:34:17,016
Oh. Pfft.

398
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:21,437
- Maybe not,
but he's got real character.
- Just like me.

399
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,356
I'm not the most beautiful,

400
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,359
but I'm strong and lovable.

401
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,945
Uh-huh.

402
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:34,700
This is the place.
We get a good view from here.

403
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:02,394
What do you see?

404
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:12,446
Look.

405
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,532
It's gas.

406
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:17,993
We need to sound the alarm.
Let's go.

407
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:30,005
- Halt!
- Run! Run!!

408
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,716
Stop!

409
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,594
- I said stop!
- Halt!

410
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:42,935
- The horses! Stay here! Stay!
- Stay, stay! Come on!

411
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:44,895
Stubby, go!

412
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:47,648
Go tell them, Stubby, go!

413
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:23,142
What? Stubby?
Okay! Gas!

414
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,144
Gas!

415
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:26,896
Gas!!!

416
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:32,776
Move it, move it, move it!

417
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,905
Let's go, let's go!
Get a move on!

418
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:42,953
Oh. Ah.

419
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,251
Feuer!!

420
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,106
Hey, little dog.

421
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:16,987
Oh. Oh, no.

422
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,074
Gas? Gas! Look, gas!

423
00:37:20,366 --> 00:37:22,368
The dog is trying to warn us!

424
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,913
Everybody, go inside
and put on your masks!

425
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,503
There he is! Stubby!

426
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:47,184
Oh, no,
we don't have a mask for him!
What are we gonna do?

427
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:50,187
Ah, there, there.

428
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,855
Hold on. Wait.

429
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:54,108
It's okay, Stubby. It's okay.
Good boy.

430
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,319
- You've done well.
- Allez, calme-toi. Calme-toi.

431
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,631
It's okay. Shhh.

432
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,634
Stubby, it's gonna be okay.
Shhh.

433
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,801
- Ça va?
- Ça va.

434
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,345
Hey!

435
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,805
Come here. Come here, boy.

436
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:09,725
Thank you for my whole village!

437
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,268
His name is Stubby.

438
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,230
Ah, Stubby.
You are our hero, Stubby.

439
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,567
Robert's letters were full

440
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:21,820
of just how beloved
Stubby was by everyone.

441
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,575
- Merci.
- Merci à toi.

442
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:32,706
It was as if he lived
every day through the heroics
of this little canine wonder.

443
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,083
Merci.

444
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,710
Yeah,
but they were so generous.

445
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,254
Yes, yes, but no meat.

446
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:48,597
Mm, I think this war
has just improved.

447
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,476
Mm! Like a magician,

448
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:56,563
I'm creating magic
with a simple rabbit.

449
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,485
Allez, Olsen.
Now you throw the cochonnet.

450
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:03,487
- The what?
- This.

451
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,322
Not too far, not too close.

452
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,408
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon.
I explain.

453
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,994
It must land
within six to 10 metres

454
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,539
of the starting circle.

455
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,375
Allez, Olsen,
now you throw the cochonnet.

456
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,710
- Okay.
- You can do it, Olsen.

457
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,882
Sacre bleu!
Rends-nous le cochonnet!

458
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:26,885
Give us the cochonnet, cabot!
Sale petit chien!

459
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,846
Stubby...

460
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:31,640
Drop it, Stubby. Drop it.

461
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:35,602
Ah, merci!

462
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,564
No, Stubby,
you can't take the cochonnet.

463
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:42,985
Pétanque is a very serious
business in this country.

464
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,404
War has started for less.

465
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,031
Sorry. He just...
he loves to play ball.

466
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:51,034
Mm! Ta-dah. C'est prêt!

467
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,371
Now we are ready to eat.

468
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:58,167
Ah, excuse me
for my bad manners.

469
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,794
It's your rabbit, too, Stubby.

470
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:08,802
Mm. Whoa!
This... this is really good.

471
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,638
Yes, is very tasty, huh?

472
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,308
Even if I say myself.

473
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,896
- À moi le point!
- Okay.

474
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,939
Now, if you want to score
the point -

475
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,609
you see that ball there? -
hit it hard.

476
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:28,780
You know, we should take
a little after-dinner stroll,
while we still can.

477
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,574
Yeah, sure.

478
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,409
C'mon, Stubby.

479
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,462
Nice shot.

480
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:53,805
Okay, alright.

481
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:07,861
I have no tobacco, but I carry
it everywhere with me.

482
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:10,489
It was a present from my wife.

483
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,493
I never showed you my family.

484
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,954
- Wow, three girls.
- Yes.

485
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,249
Jeanne. She's 11. Manon, eight.

486
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,334
And Madeleine, six.

487
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,461
They capture my heart
completely.

488
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,839
They would love
to play with you, Stubby.

489
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,843
They would take you
into the forest,
chasing the sanglier.

490
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:33,387
Yeah, sanglier.

491
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,347
Uh, what... what are they?

492
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:38,892
Wild pigs.
You know, with the tusks.

493
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,852
Oh, oh. Oh, I get it.

494
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,313
Your daughters chase wild pigs?

495
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:47,109
- Yes, one day,
they will make fine hunters.
- Really?

496
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:49,194
Uh, and what about you?

497
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:51,113
Uh...

498
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:55,117
My sister Margaret
is like a mom to me
and my two younger sisters.

499
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,578
She cared for our mother
before she passed,

500
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:00,539
and my dad passed away
when I was five.

501
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:03,792
I do hope to have a wife
and children one day.

502
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,754
It is the best.
My wife Alice, she's, uh -
how you say? -

503
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:12,676
nagging me all the time,
but I wouldn't change her.

504
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:16,847
- When did you last see them?
- It is more than two years.

505
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:18,640
Two years?!

506
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:22,019
Wow, that's a darned long time.

507
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:23,687
Don't you ever get lonely?

508
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:25,689
Yes. Well, sometimes.

509
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:31,945
But now you Americans are here,
it will be over soon, you know.

510
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:35,073
Two kings! I win!

511
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:39,286
Look, I have two kings! Ha-ha!
I beat you, Yankee.

512
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:42,914
Hold on a minute,
hold... hold on a minute.

513
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:46,293
I have a flush, so... I won.

514
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:49,379
Flush? Flush, flush, flush,
flush, flush...

515
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,256
What is this flush?

516
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,842
Surely the kings are the kings,
you know, the best!

517
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:59,514
So, uh...
before you were a soldier,
what did you do?

518
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:03,518
I'm a chef
in my own restaurant.
A good restaurant.

519
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,355
Ah! That's why
you're such a good cook.

520
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,524
A real French chef
cooking dinner for us, Stubby.

521
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,735
What do you think of that, huh?

522
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,196
This is how I learn
my English.

523
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,114
And you, what do you do?

524
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:19,785
I work
in a builder's hardware store,
uh, selling screws and nails.

525
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:22,788
Mm, it's not a great job,
but... it's home.

526
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,414
I miss it.

527
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:27,709
We French make home
wherever we are.

528
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:31,588
It's about food,
wine and good company.

529
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:35,175
You know, on a night like this,

530
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,928
we can forget about the war.

531
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,687
We heard the attack
and came as fast as we could!

532
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,355
Where do you want us to be,
Sergeant?

533
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:50,357
We've beaten them back
for now,

534
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:54,444
but Clayborn
is still somewhere out there.
Gotta bring him in somehow.

535
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,488
We got wounded!
We got wounded!

536
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,282
Coming through, guys,
coming through!
Mind your backs!

537
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:03,245
- Stubby!
- Come on, let's go!
- Where you going, Conroy?!

538
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:30,772
Ah, I can't see anything.

539
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:34,067
Stubby!!

540
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:45,078
Oh...

541
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:48,206
Oh...

542
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:50,250
Get down!

543
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:54,963
Smoke at 7-5-0 yards!

544
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,639
Come on, go, go, go, go, go!

545
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,478
I realized
that every day spelled danger;

546
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,606
there was no letup
for our boys.

547
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:21,573
- Come on. We're coming through.
- Go, go, go, go, go.
You're gonna be okay.

548
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:25,035
You're gonna be alright.
It's alright.
You're gonna be fine.

549
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,538
Thank you, Stubby.

550
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:34,586
I got word
in April of 1918

551
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:39,883
the Yankee Division was moving to a
new battle sector at Seicheprey.

552
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,481
Look... look at him!

553
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:57,150
Mother! How that mutt survived,
I'll never know.

554
00:46:57,442 --> 00:46:59,820
I was sure
the Boche would get him.

555
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:01,613
He is so lucky.

556
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:02,989
He's so brave.

557
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:05,867
I wish I had half his courage.

558
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,410
Courage? It's not courage.

559
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,788
It's dumb luck. Believe me.

560
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,043
- Monsieur?
- Hey, Stubby.

561
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:18,046
Monsieur Conroy, please.

562
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:20,173
Oh. Ah.

563
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,008
- Uh... sorry. Hello, ma'am
- Hello.

564
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,929
It is for Stubby.
We made it for him
to keep him warm

565
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:29,224
and to say thank you
for the day of the gas.

566
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:32,894
Ah, gee, thank you.
Merci beaucoup.

567
00:47:38,316 --> 00:47:40,819
Stubby, what do you say
to this nice lady?

568
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:45,407
No, no, not like that. You know.

569
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:51,746
You are such
a clever little dog, Stubby.

570
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:53,415
Oh, I forgot.

571
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:57,043
I have something for Stubby
my sergeant made for him.

572
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:03,425
Don't be like that,
my little friend.
This will save your life.

573
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:11,516
Thank you, Gaston.
And thank you again, ma'am.

574
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,561
Goodbye, Stubby and...

575
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,521
Monsieur Conroy.

576
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:21,026
- Take good care of yourselves.
- We'll take care
of one another.

577
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:24,154
Oui,
comme les Trois Mousquetaires
All for one...

578
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,072
...and one for all!

579
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:32,370
Well, I think
it's you she likes, Conroy, no?

580
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:43,006
Robert, Stubby and Gaston
spent the next few months

581
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:46,843
in the Sibille trench,
right in the path
of the German advance

582
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:50,055
as they desperately tried
to move on Paris.

583
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:55,226
Every soldier, cook and medic
took part in the fight.

584
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:58,980
I had no idea that Seicheprey
would be described

585
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:02,734
as the single-largest
American battle of World War I.

586
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:05,362
And my poor kid brother
and his dog

587
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,365
were smack dab in the middle
of it all.

588
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,452
A welcome sight you are,
Stubby.

589
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:14,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa there, fella.

590
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:17,165
I think he remembers you,
Colonel, sir.

591
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:19,793
Now, no more reconnaissance
for the moment.

592
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,586
The Germans
are pressing us hard,

593
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:25,090
so I need every man
reinforcing the line.

594
00:49:25,757 --> 00:49:28,885
- Yes, sir!
- À vos ordres, mon colonel.

595
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:55,370
What is it? What's going on?
What happened?
Calm down. Calm down!

596
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:26,985
Come on, come on, come on.

597
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,741
Conroy, watch out!

598
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:37,328
Come on, follow me.

599
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,628
Now let's set a trap
for these rats.

600
00:50:57,515 --> 00:50:59,476
Stubby!

601
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:13,531
Hande hoch!

602
00:51:16,451 --> 00:51:18,286
Drop your weapons!

603
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:21,498
Kamerad! Kamerad.

604
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,374
No, you are not my kamerad.

605
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:25,794
You are my prisoner.
Keep your hands up.

606
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:28,213
Good work, my friend.

607
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:30,715
I will take them now.

608
00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:32,133
Go.

609
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,472
You're such a brave boy,
you know that?

610
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:42,058
It's not over, boys!
Keep your eyes peeled!

611
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,810
They'll be back!

612
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,529
Ah!!

613
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,239
Stubby, no!!

614
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,117
Stubby!

615
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,161
Anybody hurt?!
Any wounded?!

616
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:07,125
Stubby! Stubby.

617
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:11,671
Stubby! Oh, come on. Stubby?
You'll be okay. Come on.

618
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:16,717
Come on, come on, come on.
You'll be okay,
you're gonna be okay. Come on.

619
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,139
Alright. Come on, Stubby!

620
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,642
Please stay with me.
Come on. Please stay with me.

621
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:30,022
Schroeder, Schroeder,
d'you see
what that dumb dog did?

622
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,524
He saved my life.

623
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,943
- I need a medic now!
- D'you hear me, Schroeder?

624
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:35,945
Wounded man here!

625
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,655
Quickly, we need help!

626
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:41,033
It's gonna be okay, boy.
I promise. I promise.

627
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,596
Hey, Conroy.

628
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,516
Stubby.

629
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:10,479
Stubby,
what have they done to you?
Come on.

630
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,275
- Doc! Doc, Stubby needs help.
- That's a bad wound.

631
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,195
I don't know
if there's much we can do,

632
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,363
and he's a dog, soldier.
I'm sorry.

633
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:22,700
He's my friend,
he's one of us!

634
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,995
He saved lives.
Please. Please, Doc.

635
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,496
Please.

636
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:31,709
I'm sure the doctor
will do his best. Right, Doc?

637
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:35,588
Okay, okay.
Just lay him on the ambulance.

638
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,846
You come back soon,
little dog.

639
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,349
We need our third musketeer.

640
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:50,853
Guys, make way! Move!
Alright, hurry, hurry!

641
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,356
Schroeder?

642
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,234
Let's keep moving,
keep moving.

643
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,361
Alright, get that, yes.

644
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,745
Don't worry, Conroy.
He's strong.

645
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,590
Great day to...

646
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,010
...be an American,
right, Stubby?

647
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,810
After Schroeder
and Stubby were wounded,

648
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:34,188
the fighting around Seicheprey
became ferocious.

649
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,524
And the rains came down.

650
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:40,278
It rained day after day
after day,

651
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:44,073
turning the whole place
into a quagmire.

652
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:50,538
I can only begin to imagine
how Robert missed Stubby.

653
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:54,834
He must've felt totally lost
without the little fella.

654
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,425
Come on, Conroy.
I know it's hard,

655
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:04,635
but you must stay strong.

656
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,971
German attack! Let's go!

657
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,849
The Yankee Division
was driven out

658
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:12,727
of the Sibille trench
and the town of Seicheprey.

659
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:15,855
As the Germans desperately
tried to reach Paris,

660
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:20,109
all that stood between them
and their prize were our boys.

661
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:24,196
It was a real worrying time
for all of us back home.

662
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,116
They mean business.

663
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,161
We need to stop them.

664
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:32,455
No, not now, Musketeer.

665
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,374
Tomorrow.
First, we need to rest.

666
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:40,338
I miss him too,
but I know the Three Musketeers

667
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,465
will be together again
very soon.

668
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,425
I feel it.

669
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:46,510
You think?

670
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:50,222
Yes.
And the good thing is,

671
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:55,311
we are out of those trenches,
my feet are dry at last.

672
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:57,605
All that mud and those rats,

673
00:55:57,897 --> 00:55:59,315
Argh. Dégueulasse.

674
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,400
Baptiste?

675
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:05,404
You've been ordered
to return to your regiment camp.
Grab your gear and move out.

676
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,410
Stubby, Schroeder,
and now you?

677
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,746
So much for your predictions.

678
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,664
You'll be fine.

679
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,626
But, before I leave,
just take my advice:

680
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,629
To stay alive,
you need to feel fear.

681
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,631
Fear?

682
00:56:23,923 --> 00:56:26,342
But you show no fear.
You laugh!

683
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:28,677
You mean this?

684
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:32,223
It only protects
my fragile heart.

685
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:38,104
Farewell, my good friend.

686
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,940
Until we meet again.

687
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,858
Adieu.

Adieu, mon ami.

693
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,587
After much hard fighting,

694
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:07,633
our boys retook Seicheprey
and drove the Germans back.

695
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,427
It was not until much later

696
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:13,222
that I learned just how fierce
the battle had been.

697
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,975
My dear sister Margaret,

698
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:19,145
I hope you and the girls
are keeping well.

699
00:57:19,437 --> 00:57:21,605
I'm doing just fine.

700
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,073
Even the chow is okay.

701
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,992
Well, not like your cooking,

702
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:35,286
but pretty much most of it
I can eat.

703
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:40,124
It's almost four weeks
since Stubby got hit

704
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,960
and there's still no news
of him.

705
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:45,713
I'm sure he's being
taken real good care of.

706
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:48,132
Gaston, Stubby and me,

707
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,426
we called ourselves
The Three Musketeers.

708
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,304
You know, like in the book
Mom read to us

709
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,097
when we were kids?

710
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,142
Well, the other day...

711
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:01,103
Gaston was sent back
to his regiment.

712
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,106
It's all going to be over soon,

713
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,650
and then we'll be coming home.

714
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,777
I send my love to you all.

715
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,615
Your loving brother, Robert.

716
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:15,951
Robert was always good
at putting a brave face on,

717
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,163
and I knew
that was what he was doing.

718
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,166
His two best friends gone.

719
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,668
My heart went out to him.

720
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,406
Conroy, wake up.
It's guard time.
We'll miss chow.

721
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,534
Conroy?

722
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,954
Oh, no.

723
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:45,374
Quick, we need a doctor!
My buddy is real sick!

724
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,348
- Was?
- Ein hund!

725
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,276
He's the fifth soldier
this week.

726
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:13,902
I don't know what it is.

727
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,239
Just gotta keep an eye on him.
He's too sick to move.

728
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,742
But he is gonna make it,
right, Doc?

729
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,662
I don't know.
Maybe... maybe not.

730
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:29,251
In 1918,
the whole world was seized
by a deadly flu epidemic,

731
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,545
and Robert caught it too.

732
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,757
It spread through our boys
like a poison cloud.

733
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,353
Ah! I gotta get out there
and fight. I need to get up.

734
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,229
We're good, Conroy.
We're good, we're good.

735
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,821
Everything's good.
The Boche are real quiet.

736
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,490
Just get better.

737
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,034
Mm... Stubby.

738
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,286
Where's... Stubby?

739
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,790
Just let him rest.
That's the only thing
he can do now.

740
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,312
I... I need to fight.

741
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:05,532
I was so happy to hear
that Robert was on the mend,

742
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,285
and that he and Stubby
were reunited.

743
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,248
And good news!
After six months
of hard fighting,

744
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,126
he and Stubby
went on a furlough to Paris.

745
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:20,631
Never imagined my first trip to
Paris would be in a cattle wagon.

746
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:22,424
- So glamorous!
- I remember thinking:

747
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:26,094
Maybe this dreadful war
was finally coming to an end.

748
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,598
You're gonna have to lay down
at some stage.

749
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,145
Room for one more?

750
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,481
- Hey, buddy, you made it!
- Schroeder!

751
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,067
Stubby, look, he's back!

752
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:43,487
Stubby, you're here!
What happened to you?

753
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:47,032
Uh, hello?
Why is it always about Stubby?

754
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,034
I found him.
"Thank you, Olsen,

755
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,870
for finding Stubby.
Oh, that was great!"

756
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,582
Sorry, Olsen. Come here!

757
01:04:13,793 --> 01:04:15,670
This looks nice.

758
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:23,928
What do you think, Stubby?

759
01:04:25,555 --> 01:04:28,683
- You coming, Schroeder?
- Yep, I'm with you!

760
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:05,386
In the beginning,
the French were very
suspicious of Americans,

761
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:08,473
but by the fall of 1918,
they loved us.

762
01:05:08,765 --> 01:05:10,266
Bravo!

763
01:05:16,314 --> 01:05:19,943
- Bravo aux Américains.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.

764
01:05:20,235 --> 01:05:22,320
Bravo aux Américains!

765
01:05:23,154 --> 01:05:25,240
Merci. Thanks.

766
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:32,914
Come on, let's go see Paris!
What are we waiting for?

767
01:06:08,157 --> 01:06:10,326
By September of 1918,

768
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:14,455
we were told that the war
was coming to an end,

769
01:06:14,747 --> 01:06:17,667
and that the German army
was in retreat.

770
01:06:21,212 --> 01:06:24,173
What is it, Stubby?

771
01:06:24,465 --> 01:06:28,052
Stubby.
Stubby, come back.

772
01:06:36,102 --> 01:06:37,937
Ah!

773
01:06:38,229 --> 01:06:39,647
Ah!!

774
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:45,403
No!

775
01:06:46,362 --> 01:06:49,532
Don't even think about it.

776
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,496
This is yours now, Stubby.

777
01:06:55,788 --> 01:06:57,790
You earned it.

778
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:00,627
Well,
look what Stubby sniffed out.

779
01:07:01,586 --> 01:07:03,713
Kamerad!

780
01:07:04,005 --> 01:07:05,673
- Move it!
- No! Ah!

781
01:07:09,636 --> 01:07:13,389
Come on.

782
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,560
We are here today
to mark the courage

783
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:19,395
of a very brave soldier

784
01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:22,106
who went above and beyond
the call of duty.

785
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:25,777
Private First Class Conroy
and Stubby, post!

786
01:07:28,821 --> 01:07:32,075
For his capture
of a German spy in Marcheville,

787
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:35,912
I confer the honorary rank
of Sergeant on Stubby,

788
01:07:36,204 --> 01:07:37,580
the regimental mascot.

789
01:07:37,872 --> 01:07:39,290
From this day forward,

790
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:42,001
Sergeant Stubby
will wear these stripes.

791
01:07:42,293 --> 01:07:47,048
And for you, Private Conroy,
today you are Corporal Conroy.

792
01:07:50,343 --> 01:07:52,929
Hey, Stubby,
you outrank me now.

793
01:07:58,851 --> 01:08:00,311
Gaston!

794
01:08:04,857 --> 01:08:08,945
For the newspapers back home!
Say cheese!

795
01:08:10,863 --> 01:08:12,824
The newspaper headlines

796
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:16,077
all talked about a final assault
on the Hindenburg line.

797
01:08:19,706 --> 01:08:21,582
After the return
of his friends,

798
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:24,502
Robert's letters were cheery
and full of good humour.

799
01:08:24,794 --> 01:08:29,674
He even told me a funny story about
how Stubby came face-to-face

800
01:08:29,966 --> 01:08:31,843
with a strange new beast
of war.

801
01:08:37,473 --> 01:08:38,683
Okay, Sergeant,

802
01:08:38,975 --> 01:08:43,563
I'm Captain George S. Patton
of the United States Tank Corps.

803
01:08:45,648 --> 01:08:47,483
Let's go.

804
01:08:47,775 --> 01:08:49,485
We've got a war to win.

805
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:02,040
That's my boy.

806
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:37,075
I can't believe it.

807
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:40,745
The Germans built this
like they were going
to stay forever.

808
01:09:41,037 --> 01:09:42,872
The Boche build palaces

809
01:09:43,164 --> 01:09:46,125
and we had to live
in those puddles?

810
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,920
It's over, it's over!
Did you hear?

811
01:09:49,212 --> 01:09:50,129
The war is over!

812
01:09:50,421 --> 01:09:52,006
The Germans are signing
an armistice.

813
01:09:52,298 --> 01:09:55,426
Says who?

814
01:09:55,718 --> 01:09:58,429
It's true!
The war is to end tomorrow!

815
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,431
Hey, did you hear that,
Stubby?

816
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:11,692
Hold on, hold on there,
soldiers!

817
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:15,196
Cease-fire doesn't start
till 11 a.m.!

818
01:10:15,488 --> 01:10:19,367
- Germany surrendered!
- When is it over?
- We have a war to fight!

819
01:10:24,664 --> 01:10:28,209
You know, guys,
when I get home,
I'm gonna find myself a wife.

820
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:31,003
I thought you were going
to wait until you found a job.

821
01:10:31,295 --> 01:10:35,091
Nah,
after all we've been through,
I'm ready for some home life.

822
01:10:35,383 --> 01:10:38,761
Me, too.
Can't wait to introduce Stubby
to my sisters.

823
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:40,805
I've been away so long,

824
01:10:41,097 --> 01:10:45,393
I worry my girls
will not recognize me.

825
01:10:45,685 --> 01:10:47,520
Why can't we just leave now?

826
01:10:47,812 --> 01:10:51,941
Just think, one last push
and then we're all going home.

827
01:10:52,733 --> 01:10:55,695
Well, little buddy,
we're nearly there.

828
01:10:55,987 --> 01:11:00,158
Just a few more hours and...
it'll all be over.

829
01:11:10,543 --> 01:11:14,922
Robert and Stubby
spent their last night
of the Great War

830
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:17,341
huddled together
under an oak tree.

831
01:11:17,633 --> 01:11:19,218
A man and his dog,

832
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,345
unselfish friends,

833
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:24,056
comrades in arms.

834
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,775
Drop your weapons!

835
01:13:37,898 --> 01:13:39,817
Thank you, my friend.

836
01:13:43,571 --> 01:13:46,157
I never did understand
why our boys

837
01:13:46,449 --> 01:13:50,995
were made to attack
until the very last minute
of the war.

838
01:13:51,287 --> 01:13:54,373
So many young men were lost
on that morning,

839
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:58,085
but they did their duty...
to the very end.

840
01:13:58,377 --> 01:13:59,879
We made it.

841
01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:29,450
Olsen!

842
01:14:29,742 --> 01:14:31,869
Olsen, where are you?!

843
01:14:32,161 --> 01:14:33,454
Where are you?

844
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:37,435
Well, my friends,
we have seen much together,

845
01:15:37,726 --> 01:15:41,480
and now the Three Musketeers
must say goodbye.

846
01:15:46,861 --> 01:15:48,654
Stubby!

847
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:50,739
Yes, good boy.

848
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:53,242
My friend Olsen
gave these to me.

849
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:56,454
I will always think of him
when I play poker.

850
01:15:56,745 --> 01:15:58,330
Take this and think of us.

851
01:15:58,956 --> 01:16:01,792
Goodbye, Yankees,
and thank you all.

852
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:07,715
- All for one!
- And one for all!

853
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:11,802
Vive la France!

854
01:16:12,094 --> 01:16:14,180
Vive les États-Unis!

855
01:16:22,062 --> 01:16:25,316
- We're so proud of you!
- Welcome!

856
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:39,163
- Welcome home, boys.
- Welcome back!

857
01:16:39,455 --> 01:16:41,540
Great job.

858
01:16:42,333 --> 01:16:45,544
It's so nice to have you back!

859
01:16:46,337 --> 01:16:48,380
- Whoo!
- Robert!

860
01:17:13,656 --> 01:17:16,534
A hero! You're a hero, Stubby!
