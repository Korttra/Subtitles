<i>Hello. I'm going to show you how</i>

1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,409
<i>to use the Miraculous Beauty Water.</i>

2
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,159
<i>First, get your tools ready.</i>

3
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,159
<i>Say goodbye to the face you know.</i>

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,360
<i>Maybe take a few pictures.</i>

5
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,990
<i>Now, shall we begin?</i>

6
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,449
<i>First, mix your Beauty
Water concentrate</i>

7
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,319
<i>with tap water in a ratio of 4 to 1.</i>

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,199
<i>Make sure your skin is not
exposed to the concentrate itself</i>

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,910
<i>or your flesh could melt.</i>

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,739
<i>Now place this hose
gently in your mouth</i>

11
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,489
<i>and immerse your face in
the solution for 20 minutes.</i>

12
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,620
<i>Wait, you think 20 minutes is too long?</i>

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,449
<i>That's the blink of an eye compared</i>

14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,870
<i>to the years you suffered
because of your appearance.</i>

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,779
<i>Way to go being patient!</i>

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,909
<i>You don't see much of a difference?</i>

17
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,029
<i>Give it time!</i>

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,159
<i>Your skin is more than ready to embrace</i>

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,740
<i>all the changes that will come.</i>

20
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,319
<i>Wait!</i>

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,110
<i>Before you see the next image,</i>

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,110
<i>I'm warning you not to be afraid.</i>

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,490
<i>Because this is the
transformation to beauty,</i>

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,610
<i>to a new you!</i>

25
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,990
<i>A whole new you!</i>

26
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,530
BEAUTY WATER

27
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,570
<i>Love... I just wanted to be loved...</i>

28
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,320
So you can't tell at all?

29
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,240
Apparently no one can tell
you've had any work done.

30
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,159
How does it work?

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,489
It's like putting lotion on your skin.

32
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,489
You just splash a few
drops on your face

33
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,110
and it turns you beautiful!

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,449
That's ridiculous.

35
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,029
It's stored in a bottle like that

36
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,739
and if you drink it you lose weight

37
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,320
and your face completely changes!

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,779
Nah, that's a load of crap.

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,819
What, you don't believe me?

40
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,909
I'm Mr. Kim, the epitome of trust!

41
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,449
But...

42
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,870
Have you ever met anyone who's done it?

43
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,860
Anyone who's ever sold it?

44
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,310
Where would you purchase that thing?

45
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,360
See? It's all a lie.

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,739
No, it's real! I swear!

47
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,409
I bet that's her secret to somehow

48
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,870
get more beautiful every day.

49
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,029
Don't smile at me like that! Ugh!

50
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,950
<i>Take care of your health!
"Tan Tan" tablet a day.</i>

51
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,569
Is she grumpy today too?

52
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,780
Worse than that. She's
being like a raging storm.

53
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,160
You are here.

54
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,160
The heat is killing me!

55
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,610
Wow your hair looks amazing today!

56
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,029
Are you kidding me?

57
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,030
Don't you see the split ends?

58
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,659
Mi-ri! What would you
like to wear today?

59
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,740
Why do you even get paid?

60
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,699
Do you not want to do your job?

61
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,569
Why are you asking me
what I want to wear?

62
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,739
You're the stylist!
Isn't that your job?

63
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,029
Oh... I...

64
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,030
Forget it. Ugh, It's so hot.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,410
You.

66
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,319
Didn't I tell you to wear a mask?

67
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,070
I don't like seeing your
face in the morning!

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
What are you looking at?

69
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,569
If you have a problem, then just quit!

70
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,489
Can't you do something about her?

71
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,739
Mi-ri, you seem to be
having a rough day today.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,069
Rough day? Are you
siding with that pig?

73
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,160
No, I...

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
Hello?

75
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,160
Hey, Ji-hoon!

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Who is this?

77
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,909
He's one of our new talents.

78
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,610
Isn't he good-looking?

79
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,699
It's an honor to meet you, Mi-ri.

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,030
My name is Kwon Ji-hoon.
Pleased to meet you.

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,949
Well... You're not that
bad-looking, I guess.

82
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,909
What were you doing before?

83
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,319
He's been doing lots!

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,199
Didn't you go to an Ivy League school?

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,409
Yes. I used to live in the
U.S. pursuing an MBA.

86
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,409
Wow, you must be very smart.

87
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,360
And your face... Your body... Wow!

88
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,739
None of that matters.

89
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,779
There are tons of smart kids around.

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,449
They never last.

91
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,489
I'm not like them!

92
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,989
I joined this agency because of you.

93
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,950
I want to work hard
on my craft as an actor!

94
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,909
He's pretty funny!

95
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,239
Fine. You don't know
Korea well, do you?

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,279
I'll help you.

97
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,659
That would be an honor!

98
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,910
You can go now.

99
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,659
Pleased to work with you!

100
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,240
Oh, right...

101
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,620
You have very pretty eyes.

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,950
Excuse me?

103
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,819
The color of your eyes.

104
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,620
I've never seen such beautiful eyes.

105
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,489
Ow! Huh?

106
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,110
Oh, you were still there?
Sorry, I didn't see you!

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,949
Ugh...

108
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,110
What, you're glaring at me again?

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,910
I said I was sorry!

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,530
Get out of here, you pig!

111
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,490
Oh!

112
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,989
Aren't you going to take it?

113
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,280
Oh, right... Thank you.

114
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,319
She's very different from
how she appears in the media.

115
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,989
Her staff must be really exhausted.

116
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,860
Are you going to rehearsals soon?

117
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,199
If you go to the dressing room...

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,029
Actually, I'd rather
do the makeup here.

119
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,320
What? Here?

120
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,200
Don't you prefer to be here

121
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,360
than in the dressing room, right?

122
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,610
Oh, thank you for being thoughtful.

123
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,569
And my name is Yae-ji.

124
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,489
I'm counting on you for my makeup.

125
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,320
How long have you
been in this industry?

126
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,780
Oh well, I started after I quit ballet,

127
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,409
so this year should be...

128
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,860
Ballet?

129
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,029
Yes. I was a ballet dancer before.

130
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,819
Although it's hard to imagine it now

131
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,659
I was pretty good, though.

132
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,909
So what happened?

133
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,279
I came across an invisible wall.

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,110
An invisible wall?

135
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,610
Yes. Someone like you would never know.

136
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,490
I had to face that
wall every single day

137
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,820
a terribly tall, imposing wall.

138
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,490
Hey!

139
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,489
Why are you doing makeup in here?

140
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,910
Hurry up! Rehearsals
are about to start!

141
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,410
Please hurry.

142
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,160
We'll be on the air.
Stand by, stand by.

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,370
Hurry!

144
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,450
Places, everyone! We're
on the air in three, two...

145
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,620
You have very pretty eyes.

146
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,199
Were you thinking about him just now?

147
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,870
No!

148
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,159
Let's see.

149
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,989
Wow. You have very unique eye color.

150
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,489
Your eyes are neither brown nor black.

151
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,780
Did you know that?

152
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,780
Hey! Hey there!

153
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,490
Are you Mi-ri's staff?

154
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,620
What?

155
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,530
I'm really sorry but one of
our extras couldn't make it.

156
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,360
All you need to do is
sit here, relax and eat.

157
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,820
Is this going live?

158
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,450
Not really. And you'll
be paid good money.

159
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes, I take this every single day,

160
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,489
because the set is like a battlefield.

161
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,739
I get barely any sleep.

162
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,069
But after my daily dose of Tan Tan

163
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,176
I definitely feel much better.

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,069
I love to work out, and I can

165
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,569
refresh myself with this

166
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,569
I see!

167
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,699
We're here with the goddess Lee Mi-ri

168
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,489
and a rising new star
in showbiz, Kwon Ji-hoon

169
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,319
who both recommend Tan Tan!

170
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,819
Today, for this one-time event

171
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,660
we have a very special
deal for our audience!

172
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,860
I just got word from our producer

173
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,910
that the phones are
ringing off the hook!

174
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,860
Everyone! People are
going wild over this!

175
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,489
Don't miss this one and only chance

176
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,489
to grab your special Tan Tan package!

177
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,370
What are you doing right now? Just eat!

178
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,370
Hey, look!

179
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,989
I guess Ivy Leaguers
are nothing special.

180
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,660
They're all the same.

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,489
A pretty face, skinny
body, big boobs...

182
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,200
That's all boys care about.

183
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,529
What? You guys are all there?

184
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,819
I bought enough for us all
to share and then some.

185
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,280
Yeah, I'm on my way.

186
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,700
Nice phone you've got there.

187
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,570
Nice phone you've got there.

188
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,570
You okay?

189
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,659
Stop eating so much and lose weight.

190
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,620
Then you'll be able to walk better.

191
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,699
What did you buy again?

192
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,030
Stop talking!

193
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,550
I'll buy what I want to
buy with my money!

194
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,280
What's the problem with that?

195
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,779
What on earth did you say?

196
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,950
That's no way to talk to your mother!

197
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,570
Oh right!

198
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,660
Don't I have pretty eyes?

199
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,699
What?

200
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,990
Look at them. See the color?

201
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,699
Oh my, what's wrong
with your eye color?

202
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,570
Knock it off! You're my mom
but you didn't know that?

203
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,110
You little brat!

204
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,110
Don't talk to me like that!

205
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,030
- Open this door!
- I'm tired! Leave me alone!

206
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,659
You're not the only one that's tired!

207
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,489
Open this door right now!

208
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,659
Stop it, both of you!

209
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,069
Stop what?

210
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,160
I'm trying to teach that girl a lesson!

211
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,739
Open the door right now!

212

Yae-ji doesn't live here!

Ma'am, please, if you
would just listen to me...

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,160
No! She isn't here!

244
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,110
Another reporter?

245
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,910

Yae-ji, are you going to
stay in your room forever?

258
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,360
Just open this door!

259
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,569
It's been months!

260

266
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,069
Did you know that?

267
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,320
A little bit.

268
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,699
Did you hear Ji-hoon
decided to leave the project?

269
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,410
Huh?

270
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,909
Aren't you with the same agency?

271
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,360
Did you hear anything about it?

272
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,409
No, I'm afraid not.

273
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,530
Kwon Ji-hoon left the project? Why?

274
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,360
Are you dreaming of a new life?

<i>Thank you.</i>

281
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,700
How can they send me something

282
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,610
when they don't know my address?

283
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,950
Idiots are everywhere!

284
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,319
Yae-ji, are you sleeping?

285
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,410
There's a package for you.

286
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,740
Liar. No one would send me any...

287
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,780
A package?

288
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,569
It's just a face wash?

289
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,450
This crap is no Beauty Water.

290
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,620
You've got to be kidding me...

291
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,860
She opened the door today?

292
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,909
She opened it at once after I told
her there was a package for her.

293
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,159
A package? What package?

294
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,950
How should I know?

295
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,910
Mom, Dad. Do I look weird?

296
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,660
Um... I have a reservation
for 12 o'clock under Yae-ji.

297
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,699
You've never seen me before, have you?

298
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,569
I didn't recognize you
on the cameras, either.

299
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,660
Given this was your first time,

300
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,530
you've made some
mistakes here and there.

301
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,030
Look at this mess.

302
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,660
You're going to make me blush

303
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,120
if you stare at me like that.

304
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,989
You were a makeup artist
so you must have heard.

305
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,069
This is used by celebrities,

306
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,239
the wives of politicians,
and rich ladies.

307
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,779
It's all the craze.

308
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,320
So why did you ask
someone like me to come?

309
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,610
I mean, I'm no celebrity.

310
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,449
I needed a spokesmodel.

311
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,530
A spokesmodel?

312
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,030
I'm sorry if I offended you,

313
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,239
but the text you've got wasn't a spam.

314
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,200
It was a message for you.

315
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,779
Sorry. We did some background research

316
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,610
small things like your job,
address, phone number...

317
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,699
What have you done!

318
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,739
Whoa, whoa. Don't be
mad. I really need you.

319
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,280
And to be honest, you
want to be like me, don't you?

320
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,620
Don't you?

321
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,610
Would you like to be a model for us?

322
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,530
There is no better
spokesmodel than you.

323
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,740
Would it be for free?
If I were your model.

324
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,069
Well, this is rather expensive,

325
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,529
so why don't we agree
to do this at cost?

326
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,700
That's 1/10th of the price.

327
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,320
Which is how much?

328
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,110
- 200,000 USD?
- 200,000 USD?

329
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,660
I need the money. Now.

330
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,199
Where are we going to
get that kind of money?

331
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,199
Don't you see how my face has changed?

332
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,159
This is the only chance I'll have!

333
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,279
Yae-ji, this is all too sudden.

334
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,780
I don't know what to make of this.

335
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,410
Don't you feel sorry for me?

336
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,360
- Yae-ji!
- No.

337
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,239
Get me that money now!

338
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,989
Okay, okay! Just put that knife down!

339
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,360
You don't know anything!

340
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,949
I was born so ugly and I've
been a failure all my life!

341
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,449
You'll never know that pain.

342
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,739
I've been laughed at all my life!

343
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,950
All I wanted to do was die!

344
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,990
Give me that money now!
200 thousand dollars!

345
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,410
Come in.

346
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,780
When you wake up,

347
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,120
you'll be dozens of
times prettier than her.

348
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,910
What's all this?

349
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Who are you?

350
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,530
Mom!

351
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,820
Are you Yae-ji?

352
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,030
Mom!

353
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,199
What happened? Is this really you?

354
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,870
Yes, Mom.

355
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,529
It's me, Yae-ji.

356
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,280
My goodness!

357
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,029
I'm going to be a good daughter
from now on. I promise.

358
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,370
Yes, yes, thank you, Yae-ji. Thank you.

359
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,700
Mom...?

360
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,739
Do you have some money?

361
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,279
What?

362
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,909
I need 5,000 USD.

363
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,569
5,000 USD?

364
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,069
What, you don't have any money?

365
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,909
Look how beautiful I am!

366
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,319
I can't go back to wearing this trash!

367
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,610
But we were barely able
to get the 200,000 USD!

368
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,779
So do you have the money or not?

369
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,909
I'm going to be the most
beautiful woman in the world!

370
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,370
Who cares about a few bucks?

371
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,820
Do you have the money or not?

372
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,159
Are you one of our new neighbors?

373
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,280
Excuse me?

374
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,449
Pleasure to meet you.

375
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,239
I'm a security guard here.

376
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,570
Oh... Hello.

377
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,950
If there's anything
you need let me know

378
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,780
and I'll fix it for you.

379
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,990
Thank you...

380
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,370
Nice smell.

381
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,069
Why is everyone looking at me?

382
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,740
Do I look weird with these clothes?

383
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,910
Wait... Are they looking
at me because I'm pretty?

384
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,240
So this is how it feels!

385
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,660
<i>A real goddess! Who is she?</i>

386
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,530
<i>A movie star? I want to meet her!</i>

387
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,029
13,000 USD?

388
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,569
How could you spend
13,000 USD in half the day!

389
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,360
Are you insane?

390
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,659
Don't you get it?

391
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,739
You have to make an investment
if you want a return.

392
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,069
Investment?

393
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,779
What will I get out
of shoes and clothes?

394
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,529
We can't live so pathetic
like this forever.

395
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,950
Besides, I've told you already
that Yae-ji is dead.

396
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,870
My name is Sul-hye. Kim Sul-hye.

397
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,409
I usually don't say this

398
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,489
to women I've met for the first time

399
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,110
but you are exactly the
woman of my dreams.

400
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,870
Really? It's an honor to hear that

401
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,950
from such a hotshot CEO.

402
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,700
<i>Liar. Who does he think he's fooling?</i>

403
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,990
<i>This is going to make me fat.</i>

404
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,030
Don't you like the food?

405
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,409
No, it's delicious but...

406
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,319
Are you worried about your figure?

407
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,779
Yes.

408
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,699
Don't worry. You don't
have to worry about

409
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,610
gaining weight if you work out with me.

410
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,699
Really? Then why don't
we have a glass of wine?

411
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,699
Wine? Oh... What about beer?

412
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,239
Beer?

413
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,989
How did you know I liked beer?

414
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,070
Excuse me!

415
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,489
<i>Loser.</i>

416
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,319
<i>Bad enough I'm eating cheap steak</i>

417
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,110
<i>and you're only getting me beer?</i>

418
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,280
<i>You're out.</i>

419
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,910
Do you ever think about
where we're from,

420
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,370
and where we're headed?

421
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,120
<i>You're no fun. Go home.</i>

422
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,990
I recently switched to
a Mercedes E Class

423
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,529
and it rides much better.

424
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,280
Very comfortable.

425
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,030
<i>Get lost, kid. I know that's
your mommy's car.</i>

426
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,779
Do you want to go
somewhere this weekend?

427
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,569
I'm afraid I have plans.

428
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,490
Oh... I made reservations

429
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,410
at a pool party in Chungdam for you.

430
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,910
A Chungdam pool party?

431
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,610
Oh, I made a mistake.

432
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,739
I think I'm free this weekend.

433
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,530
Really? Then let's have some fun!

434
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,029
Face it. She stood you up.

435
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,569
She's not coming.

436
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,240
No, Sul-hye keeps her promises!

437
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,699
Hi.

438
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,780
Sul-hye...

439
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,240
You're really popular on social media

440
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,409
but you're more beautiful in person.

441
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,239
Right? Right?

442
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,030
Sul-hye's never had work done.
Isn't that right, Sul-hye?

443
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,870
Huh? Right...

444
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,200
Wait, why am I hiding from her?

445
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,280
Sul-hye wait, you can't
go in there, Sul-hye!

446
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,320
You can't go in there!

447
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,029
Why not? Why can't we go in there?

448
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,950
That place is only for VVIPs.

449
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,030
VVIP?

450
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,489
My mommy said that
place is only for celebrities

451
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,069
or those who are wealthy and famous.

452
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,700
You'll be embarrassed
in spite of your pretty face.

453
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,370
There's no better one to
find. I would be your best.

454
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,279
So why don't we just...

455
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,410
Don't touch me!

456
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,370
Sul-hye... Sul-hye!

457
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,110
Excuse me...

458
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
Shit, what do you want?

459
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,010
You think complaining
will get you somewhere

460
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,870
since you've got the looks.

461
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:05,819
But life ain't that simple.

462
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,909
You've heard of Gwang
Entertainment, right?

463
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,120
I'm a director there. Will you call me?

464
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,819
I'm the man responsible
for turning Mi-ri into a star.

465
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,530
I can make you a star, too.

466
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,660
Have we met before?

467
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,239
No! What are you talking about?

468
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,319
I'll think about this at home.

469
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,240
Thank you. I hope to do
business with you soon.

470
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,699
<i>Why won't you take my calls?</i>

471
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,779
<i>Why won't you text me back?</i>

472
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,569
<i>Are you leaving me on read?</i>

473
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,989
<i>Don't you like me anymore?</i>

474
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,120
<i>My mom always said
it's bad to ignore people!</i>

475
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,490
<i>Go back to your mama's titties, boy.</i>

476
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,780
Did I gain weight?

477
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,530
Who are you!

478
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,030
Who are you!

479
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,450
I'm... You.

480
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,410
No! No! You're not me!

481
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,870
You should exercise instead
of using more Beauty Water.

482
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,409
This will be the last time.

483
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,159
My agency will take care
of me once I sign with them,

484
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,720
so I won't even need more Beauty Water.

485
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,240
You're really going to be a celebrity?

486
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,700
I have to shoot to the
top. On the first try.

487
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,280
What should I do with her...

488
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,070
Oh, I must have fallen asleep.

489
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,700
Has it been 30 minutes?

490
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,320
Huh?

491
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,240
No! Oh! No!

492
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,360
Mom... Mom!

493
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,870
Help me, Mom!

494
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,160
Yae-ji!

495
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,909
Yae-ji, what's... Oh!

496
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,620
Yae...

497
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,870
Yae-ji...

498
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,779
Yae-ji, wake up, Yae-ji!

499
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,239
How could this happen?

500
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,120
Yae-ji! Yae-ji, wake up!

501
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,529
Why won't you take her to the hospital?

502
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,409
What will we tell them?

503
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,530
How will we explain to
them what happened?

504
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,030
We can't just leave her like this!

505
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,110
Yae-ji once said Beauty
Water allows you

506
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,699
to get rid of flesh but
also to put some on.

507
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,410
Put more flesh on her? But what's left?

508
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,739
We can use that... instead.

509
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,570
Will that be enough?

510
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,870
Yae-ji, are you awake?

511
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,610
Mom, Dad, what happened to your faces?

512
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
Huh?

513
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,569
Yae-ji, I'm sorry...

514
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,780
We gave you all the flesh we
had, but it wasn't enough.

515
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,779
- Yae-ji...
- Don't!

516
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,620
Yae-ji!

517
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,780
Ahhh!

518
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,530
It's Yae-ji.

519
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,990
What did you do to yourself?

520
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,780
And the money?

521
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,569
You've got to be kidding me.

522
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,610
I can give you more! I'll bring more!

523
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,739
If you could just start the
procedure...

524
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,110
This isn't enough for one
bottle of Beauty Water.

525
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,860
But I gave you over
200 thousand dollars!

526
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,659
You can't do this to me!

527
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,320
I can't do what to you?

528
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,449
Do you even have a conscience?

529
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,570
I saved you from a garbage life

530
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,069
and now you're begging me for more?

531
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,909
Why couldn't you take
better care of yourself?

532
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,279
Idiot.

533
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,779
Go home.

534
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,450
Come back with more money.

535
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,070
Wait, please!

536
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,200
Please don't do this to me!

537
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,570
Don't touch me! You're disgusting!

538
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,990
Please...

539
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,529
I'll do anything you ask!

540
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,120
Please save me!

541
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,660
Will you lick it?

542
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,660
No? You said you'll do anything.

543
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,910
Ha, you're about to hit rock bottom!

544
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,300
Take off your clothes and come with me.

545
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,660
You're all done. Get up.

546
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,740
Already?

547
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,160
Happy now?

548
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,279
Wow...

549
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,910
Now get out.

550
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,450
Huh?

551
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:55,029
Oh! What's going on?

552
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,449
What about my body?

553
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,200
Look at your fingers.

554
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,909
You get as much as your money's worth.

555
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,279
I gave you your face
because I felt bad for you.

556
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,699
Now bring me more money.

557
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,529
Wait, this isn't what we discussed.

558
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,449
You agreed to fix me first
and I'd pay you later.

559
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,910
When did I agree to that?

560
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,569
Do you have any idea

561
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,200
how hard it is to find
good flesh these days?

562
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,699
Wait, I can't live like this!

563
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,860
Cut it out!

564
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,110
Don't touch me!

565
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,069
It's not like you're dying.

566
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,489
If you're broke, find me more flesh!

567
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,159
Flesh?

568
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,950
If I find more flesh,
will you do it for free?

569
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,990
And how will you find more flesh?

570
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,279
What, you're going to kill someone?

571
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,779
Crazy bitch.

572
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,990
It's always the pigs
who go crazy first.

573
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,820
One time is never enough.

574
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,240
The fatties always want more.

575
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,370
This is ridiculous. You
should know your place.

576
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,949
What did you say to me, bitch?

577
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,280
What did you call me?

578
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,370
Did you call me a pig? A fatty?

579
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,159
I'm not a pig.

580
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,449
I'm a human being. Just like you!

581
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,450
Apologize to me. Say you're sorry!

582
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
What an idiot.

583
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,950
I said, apologize!

584
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,700
What did you call me?
What did you call me?

585
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,110
Are you insane?

586
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
Hey!

587
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,450
I was going easy on you

588
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,870
and now you are doing this to me?

589
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,070
Who do you think you are? You crazy...!

590
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,120
Die! Die! Die!

591
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,490
Die!

592
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,570
Oh!

593
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,529
<i>The recent wave of
serial disappearances</i>

594
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,990
<i>of young women in their 20s in Seoul</i>

595
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,949
<i>has much of the nation
incredibly worried.</i>

596
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:13,199
<i>The police installed an
investigation HQ a few months ago</i>

597
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,489
<i>but they were unable to
identify any suspects...</i>

598
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:16,989
What's wrong?

599
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,989
I've been eating junk for days!

600
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,470
My stomach can't handle this anymore.

601
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,569
Be quiet.

602
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,950
And eat.

603
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,200
I hate this.

604
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,409
Hello?

605
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,360
Hi, Mom.

606
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,610
The lady felt bad for
what happened to me

607
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,820
and agreed to do the procedure.

608
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,449
She told me not to worry
about the money

609
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,530
because she really wanted to help me.

610
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,370
Don't worry, Mom.

611
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,450
She is calling me now.

612
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,370
I'll call you later when it's done.

613
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,990
Why did you have to be so cold?

614
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,030
This is all your fault.

615
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,990
From now on, I'm going to be happy.

616
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,370
And everyone will love me.

617
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,990
I mean, there are so many
beautiful women these days

618
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,860
so I don't think I've considered myself

619
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,490
to be that pretty.

620
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,450
Flaws? Every girl has those
flaws she thinks she has.

621
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,659
Of course I thought of plastic surgery

622
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,069
but I was scared of
going under the knife.

623
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,319
In the end, I just had
to work really hard!

624
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,319
And that's when...

625
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,159
Tan Tan was there to help!

626
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,199
<i>I definitely feel less tired,</i>

627
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,160
<i>and my body and skin
feel so much better.</i>

628
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,950
<i>My friends are all on Tan Tan, too!</i>

629
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,910
Sul-hye, they've completely
sold out! Again!

630
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,489
You scared me.

631
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:22,739
Sorry.

632
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,990
Tomorrow you've got shoots

633
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,610
and interviews lined up all day.

634
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,779
Did you take a look at
the script I sent you?

635
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,780
Yes.

636
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,860
The director's totally
got his eyes on you.

637
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,739
You know all the new
actors they handpick

638
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,030
go on to become mega stars!

639
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,110
Do you really think I
can take on that role?

640
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,860
Oh, poor baby, don't you worry!

641
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,280
Just trust me.

642
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,739
Everything is on high gear!

643
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,360
The world is your oyster now!

644
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:48,370
Thanks.

645
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,320
Sorry.

646
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,370
Where is Mi-ri these days?

647
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,950
I'd like to meet her.

648
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,160
Let's go home. I'll drive you.

649
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,949
My God. She has a new post!

650
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,240
Look at this.

651
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,489
She blew off all her
interviews and disappeared

652
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,070
and now this bitch is
taking selfies online!

653
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,860
Even her family doesn't
know where she is.

654
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,699
I think she's overseas.
She thinks she's invincible.

655
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,370
Did something happen?

656
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,159
I think she had problems
with her big connection.

657
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,370
Connection?

658
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,450
Do you know how Mi-ri

659
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:37,030
was able to shoot to the top at one go?

660
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,530
How she had a huge mansion

661
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,370
and a fancy car even as a young star?

662
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,780
Because she had it.

663
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,820
A really powerful connection.

664
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,410
Would you like a meeting, too?

665
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:54,990
What?

666
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,490
There's someone who is
very much interested in you.

667
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,570
I'll walk home.

668
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,410
Thank you.

669
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,029
Were you taking pictures?

670
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,740
No, No! I...

671
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,410
Oh, that's a new phone...

672
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,240
Nice phone you've got there.

673
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,370
Oh!

674
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:48,280
Ah!

675
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,030
Oh no, this shouldn't be happening.

676
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,910
The screen is cracked...

677
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,370
Are you all right?

678
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,660
Are you hurt?

679
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,490
That's Sul-hye!

680
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,450
<i>So, are you being loved yet?</i>

681
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,280
Ah!

682
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,870
Why so surprised?

683
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,660
Aren't you going to take it?

684
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,530
She smells nice.

685
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,779
Wow, look at her. Seriously!

686
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,819
I think I've seen her on TV before.

687
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,949
Ah, Tan Tan supplements!

688
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,620
Tan Tan? Is she a new celebrity?

689
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,620
He has to be here.

690
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,740
Excuse me?

691
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,370
You're Ji-hoon, aren't you?

692
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,320
I did that?

693
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,029
You don't remember?

694
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,110
I remember everything.

695
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,199
I'm so sorry.

696
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,449
I think I'd remember you

697
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:51,280
if we met when you were a trainee.

698
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,530
I was having a hard time

699
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,860
because I kept failing auditions

700
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:59,199
but you really cheered me up.

701
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,239
Really? What did I say to you?

702
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,070
Well... You said...

703
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,779
You mentioned my eyes.

704
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,819
Your eyes?

705
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,069
Yes. You looked into my eyes and

706
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,199
told me I had pretty eyes.

707
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,320
I said that?

708
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,120
Let's see.

709
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,159
You really have pretty eyes.

710
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,780
Stop that.

711
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,530
Sorry. But I truly don't remember.

712
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:41,659
You must be very popular though.

713
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,740
Huh?

714
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,490
I'd like to take you out
for dinner in a quiet place,

715
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,569
so that I can apologize.

716
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,700
Would that be okay?

717
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,569
These days, I work in
international finance investment

718
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,570
which is what I majored in school.

719
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,909
I crunch numbers all
day and use English,

720
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,200
which is a big headache.

721
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,409
But why...

722
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,320
Why did I quit acting?

723
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,319
Well... I wasn't comfortable being in

724
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,530
the entertainment industry
working as an actor.

725
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,279
It looks fancy on the outside

726
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,120
but the industry is
like an empty shell.

727
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,239
Of course I'm not saying
that about your work.

728
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,110
There are advantages too.

729
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,120
I'm having dinner
with you, for instance.

730
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,450
So...

731
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,870
Do you know why Mi-ri
disappeared from the public eye?

732
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,620
You should be careful too, Sul-hye.

733
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,240
That manager...

734
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,860
<i>Why did you blow him
off like that last night?</i>

735
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,120
<i>Do you have any idea how
angry the Chairman is?</i>

736
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,159
Then what should I do.

737
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,449
I'm not at that old
geezer's beck and call.

738
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,490
What?

739
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,110
And why are you stealing
money from me, you crook?

740
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,449
The money I got was not
what the old man promised!

741
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,110
What did you just say to me?

742
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,819
You heard me, you bastard.

743
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,570
- Give me my money!
- You bitch!

744
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,950
You think you're such a star, do you?

745
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,819
Never forget.

746
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,239
I can make you or break you

747
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,870
with the snap of my fingers.

748
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,409
I guess that was the day

749
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,410
when I realized I had to leave.

750
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:45,610
With Mi-ri, I think she
got off on a wrong start.

751
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,529
Which leads me to this, Sul-hye.

752
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:51,739
I hope you can find your own happiness.

753
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,199
My own happiness?

754
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,489
Yes. I don't know what
kind of success you're after

755
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,610
but don't choose the
wrong, unfair path.

756
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,120
Because that path will
never make you happy.

757
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,319
Never.

758
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,449
Look at me, I'm out of line.

759
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,620
I'm so sorry.

760
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,160
Not at all.

761
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,740
I had a great time. Get home safe.

762
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,160
You too.

763
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:34,319
Ji-hoon?

764
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,739
Yes?

765
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:41,070
Are you seeing anyone?

766
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,120
<i>Three Months Later</i>

767
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,610
<i>Ji-hoon, what are these shoes for?</i>

768
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,449
<i>They're a present for
signing with a new agency.</i>

769
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,320
<i>I noticed how you couldn't
take your eyes off</i>

770
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,370
<i>that ad in the magazine.</i>

771
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:16,659
<i>You remembered?</i>

772
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,779
<i>I remember everything about you.</i>

773
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,240
<i>You'll see more surprises</i>

774
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,120
<i>down the road, so try them on!</i>

775
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:26,570
More surprises?

776
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,739
He's so cute.

777
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,110
Sul-hye, are you ready?

778
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,909
We need you in ten minutes.

779
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,910
Okay.

780
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,489
<i>Ji-hoon, I have to go on set.</i>

781
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,909
<i>Good luck, Sul-hye!</i>

782
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,530
<i>Thanks. I love you!</i>

783
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,370
What's this?

784
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,120
No! No!

785
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,450
Ah!

786
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,110
So are you being loved?

787
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,410
Ahhhhhhhh!

788
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,160
Sul-hye!

789
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:23,029
Huh?

790
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,530
What's going on?

791
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:41,239
Yae-ji, what are you doing home?

792
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,740
Shouldn't you be on set?

793
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:46,530
Mom, I need your flesh!

794
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,990
Don't you see my face?

795
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,160
What?

796
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,320
I have an important appointment today!

797
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,029
What, you don't want to help me?

798
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,569
It's not that, Yae-ji...

799
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,239
I'm not asking you to die for me!

800
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,070
I just want some of your flesh!

801
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,860
Yae-ji... What's wrong with you?

802
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:08,949
What?

803
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,489
Don't you see what's
happening to my face?

804
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,449
Please help me!

805
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,700
Yae-ji...

806
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,950
You're already beautiful.

807
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:54,950
Ji-hoon!

808
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,319
I'm so sorry!

809
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
The shoot ran late and...

810
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,819
Do you know what time it is?

811
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,240
Why didn't you call?

812
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,660
Ji-hoon... Are you mad?

813
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,029
What happened?

814
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,569
What's wrong?

815
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,569
Your face...

816
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,620
What happened to your face?

817
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,489
Your face is...

818
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,699
So gorgeous!

819
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,490
Hey! Come on!

820
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,370
Would you like to go for a walk?

821
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,370
What is it, Sul-hye?

822
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:50,699
Why? Is something wrong?

823
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,620
What am I to you?

824
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,490
What?

825
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,989
Have you told your parents about me?

826
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,870
Do your friends know about me?

827
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,360
I knew it... I guess I'm not the one.

828
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,909
Why would you say that?

829
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,739
I've never said that.

830
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,739
But your actions say otherwise.

831
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,530
You don't trust me.

832
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:25,159
Sul-hye, I've been meaning
to have this conversation

833
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,570
but I feel like you're
hiding something from me.

834
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,620
I don't know what it is
exactly. It's just a feeling.

835
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,319
But when I'm with
you I feel your anxiety

836
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,949
and darkness coming across.

837
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,069
I've always felt that from you.

838
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,700
Am I right to feel those things?

839
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,490
If I'm right, tell me what's going on.

840
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,860
I want to know, because I love you.

841
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,320
I want to know everything about you.

842
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,370
I...

843
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,779
I want to tell you everything,

844
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,739
but I'm so afraid.

845
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,110
I'm afraid you're going to hate me

846
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:12,240
if I tell you the truth, that
you're going to leave me.

847
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,990
Ji-hoon, what's this?

848
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,070
Sul-hye, if you can't
tell me right now,

849
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,449
you don't have to.

850
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,280
I'll be with you forever,

851
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,110
and help you get rid of the darkness.

852
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,450
Ji-hoon...

853
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,410
Will you be with me?

854
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,069
I'm sorry. I wasn't sure
I could tell my friends

855
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,069
and family about you
because you're a celebrity.

856
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,370
I didn't want to create a scandal.

857
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,159
How did you know my ring size?

858
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,410
Because I hold your hands every day.

859
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:10,620
You're such a smooth talker.

860
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,239
Sul-hye, want to come
over to my house tonight?

861
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,240
Your house?

862
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:17,319
You've always wanted to come visit.

863
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,490
I'll make you a delicious dessert.

864
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,239
It's so nice.

865
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,700
I'm sorry the place is a mess.

866
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,739
This painting is...

867
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,700
That's by one of my favorite artists.

868
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,239
Where are you?

869
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,110
That was taken before I was born.

870
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,860
There's a pretty big age gap
between my sisters and me.

871
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,409
You have sisters?

872
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,410
Didn't I tell you?

873
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,110
Your mother is beautiful.

874
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,239
And your older sister looks
just like her, like an angel!

875
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,820
And your younger sister...

876
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,860
What, she's a little ugly?

877
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,370
No, no, I mean she looks... Different.

878
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:29,949
But my younger sister
was the real angel.

879
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,239
She was smart, too.

880
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,700
Were you closer to your younger sister?

881
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,700
Yes, and you'll love her
when you two meet.

882
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,700
Feel free to look around.

883
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,489
What are you doing?

884
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:52,909
Just you wait.

885
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,239
I'm going to whip up
a delicious dessert.

886
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,950
You know how to cook?

887
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,120
I told you I was full of surprises.

888
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:04,110
Thank you, Ji-hoon.

889
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,740
I'm so happy.

890
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,490
What is it?

891
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:17,529
Nothing, I heard a strange noise.

892
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,910
A strange noise?

893
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,949
Or maybe I'm wrong.

894
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,200
Probably.

895
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,410
Go wait in the living room.

896
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,320
Okay.

897
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,120
No wonder he's so smart...

898
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,820
This is Ji-hoon's younger sister...

899
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,370
He got me a present?

900
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,659
Aren't you going to eat?

901
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,320
I made this myself.

902
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:32,990
Do you think it won't taste very good?

903
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,360
No it's not that. I'm a little full.

904
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,909
But I worked so hard
to make it for you.

905
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:40,160
Try a bite.

906
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,320
Say ah.

907
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,450
Ah.

908
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,990
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

909
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,819
Oh, no wonder you didn't want to eat.

910
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,120
It's down the hallway to your left.

911
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,040
Promise you'll have a
bite when you get back!

912
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,410
Sul-hye, what are you doing?

913
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,949
Oh, I...

914
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,740
The bathroom is to your left.

915
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,700
Hah... Hah... Hah... Ji-hoon!

916
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,820
Who are you?

917
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,950
Who are you!

918
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,200
Someone who loves you.

919
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,739
Did you think I wouldn't know?

920
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,320
I could tell as soon
as I saw your eyes.

921
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,370
Thank you for coming back.

922
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,240
A long time ago, there was a sweet,

923
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,409
little angel of a girl.

924
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:18,110
She was smart and very talented.

925
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,409
But every time people
saw her they frowned

926
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:23,240
and clucked their tongues.

927
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:30,120
Because she was so ugly.

928
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:39,240
But you know what? Everyone
loved her big sister

929
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:44,910
no matter if she lied, or
stole or bullied other kids.

930
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,740
They loved her.

931
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,740
Why?

932
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,870
Because she was so pretty.

933
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,820
That's when the ugly girl realized.

934
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,370
Nothing matters more
than being beautiful.

935
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:11,240
That's the most important
thing in the world.

936
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:30,659
I'm sure you know that too, Sul-hye.

937
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,699
You've faced that terrible wall before.

938
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,200
The shame of being born ugly.

939
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,450
Sul-hye!

940
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,069
I'm sorry, Sul-hye.

941
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:24,490
You won't make it out alive.

942
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,820
It's all over.

943
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,240
This will hurt a little.

944
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,360
Yae-ji, it's okay to
come in second best.

945
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,120
That's still very, very good.

946
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,950
Don't lie to me!

947
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,029
Why did I come in second place?

948
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:24,569
I did a much better job than her!

949
01:14:24,570 --> 01:14:26,860
It's because I'm ugly!

950
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:30,659
- Everyone hates me because I'm ugly!
- No, Yae-ji.

951
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:33,779
But I love you more than anything.

952
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,110
We don't care if you come
in first place or last.

953
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,160
Mommy and Daddy love you so much.

954
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:42,950
Mom...

955
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,239
Daddy, who's that?

956
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,620
Can we help you?

957
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:57,450
Mom, Dad, it's me, Sul-hye!

958
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,779
Sul-hye?

959
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:02,120
Honey, do you know that woman?

960
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,360
Why don't you recognize
me? It's me, Sul-hye.

961
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,570
I mean, it's me, Yae-ji.

962
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,699
Yae-ji?

963
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,529
You're Yae-ji?

964
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:17,449
Why are you playing games?

965
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:22,240
It's me, Yae-ji! Your daughter!

966
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:09,910
You're awake?

967
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:13,449
Relax.

968
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:16,240
You'll only hurt yourself doing that.

969
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,240
I love my makeup today.

970
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,909
You know what, Sul-hye?

971
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:38,739
Ever since I was little I've
been obsessed with beauty.

972
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:42,319
I received numerous procedures
but they never worked.

973
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,489
I couldn't truly change
my original face

974
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:45,659
as I'm sure you know.

975
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,489
So I thought I should kill myself.

976
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,610
But then I met my savior!

977
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,780
Tada!

978
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,860
You've never seen the
concentrate, right?

979
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:58,449
This isn't watered down at all.

980
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:01,360
And it made me beautiful.

981
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,620
Just like you.

982
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,820
But...

983
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:09,990
There were so many other
pretty girls in the world.

984
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,870
What? You've used this before.

985
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,910
Hold still.

986
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,490
I said hold still!

987
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,530
Good girl.

988
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,610
So that's why I decided
to become a man.

989
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,160
A man who can collect

990
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,070
the most beautiful women in the world.

991
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,370
Want to see all my treasures?

992
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,360
Aren't they beautiful?

993
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:05,610
The fakers can never beat what's real.

994
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:10,160
Oh, you said you wanted
to see Mi-ri, right?

995
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,320
Mi-ri has a beautiful
nose but her eyes...

996
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:50,280
That's why I've been looking for you.

997
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:59,070
Because your eyes are absolute jewels.

998
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,620
Now...

999
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,370
You can truly be with me.

1000
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:28,569
<i>I just... I just wanted to be loved.</i>

1001
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,280
<i>I just...</i>

1002
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:39,620
BEAUTY WATER

1003
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,280
Excuse me?

1004
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:01,320
Yes? What is it?

1005
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,279
Oh, I'm not a strange man.

1006
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,699
You've heard of Gwang
Entertainment, right?

1007
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:07,620
I'm a director there,

1008
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:09,370
and I'm in charge of talent management.

1009
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:16,569
I noticed how stylish you are.

1010
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:18,700
Will you drop me a line sometime?

1011
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:24,990
I'll think about it.

1012
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,989
May I take a photo of you?

1013
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:32,620
I want to give the agency
a little preview.

1014
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:37,320
Sure.

1015
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:46,239
I hope the Chairman likes this one.

1016
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,240
That old jerk is hard to please.

1017
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,530
Tough to make a living these days.

1018
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:04,659
<i>Chairman, are you well?</i>

1019
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:07,069
<i>I've found the real deal this time.</i>

1020
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:09,030
<i>You won't be disappointed.</i>

1021
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,950
I think we're in for a real treat.

1022
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,659
Because I found the
perfect set of lips for you girls.

1023
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,740
Aren't you happy?

1024
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:44,069
I'll give you the greatest beauty.

1025
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:47,320
You'll all love it.

1026
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:52,030
After all, isn't that what you wanted?

1027
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:55,570
I love you.

1028
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,450
Forever.
