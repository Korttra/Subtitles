សូមរីករាយទស្សនាដោយសេរី

3
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,250
Before hero Guo Jing

4
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,416
died in the battle at Xiangyang,

5
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,875
he forged the fabled Darksteel Sword
belonging to the Condor Hero, Yang Guo,

6
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,750
into two weapons,

7
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,416
namely the Heavenly Sword
and the Dragon Saber.

8
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,791
Thereafter,

9
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,833
the battles for those weapons

10
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,208
created much bloodshed
in the martial world.

11
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,416
Ming Sect's Golden Haired Lion King,
Xie Xun, had the Dragon Saber,

12
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,875
but his senior Cheng Kun,
in trying to steal it,

13
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,208
killed over 100 kung fu experts
from the Six Major Sects,

14
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,750
then framed and blinded him.

15
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:54,125
Fortunately, Xie Xun's best friend,
Zhang Cuishan of Wudang, rescued him.

16
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,875
Together with his lover, Yin Susu,

17
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,833
they escaped with Xie Xun
to Ice Fire Island

18
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,208
to avoid the martial world's fury.

19
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,958
There, Zhang Cuishan
and his wife had a son,

20
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,083
who was named Zhang Wuji.

21
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,166
The martial world's sovereign

22
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,291
is the Dragon Saber.

23
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,416
It commands all.

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,583
No one dares disobey.

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,791
Without the Heavenly Sword,

26
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,041
no one can challenge it.

27
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,375
It is said

28
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,875
that within these two weapons,

29
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,583
a critical secret is hidden.

30
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,041
Whoever possesses them

31
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,750
will reign in the martial world.

32
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,291
Father.

33
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,291
Mother.

34
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,625
With your wisdom,

35
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,416
haven't you found the secret?

36
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,041
This secret

37
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,625
must be kept hidden

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,916
or the martial world

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,916
will get into a crippling disaster.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,875
Our son is grown.

41
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,833
It's time to take him back
to the Central Plains.

42
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,208
-Xie Xun.
-Godfather.

43
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,666
Wuji is already 15 years old.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,625
My master, Zhang Sanfeng, will be
celebrating his birthday very soon.

45
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,416
I want to take Wuji to Wudang for a visit.

46
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,291
After all, since his birth,

47
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,875
he has never left Ice Fire Island,

48
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,041
nor met other people.

49
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,541
I think

50
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,208
this will be good for him.

51
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,666
Cuishan.

52
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,666
Everyone in the martial world

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,833
knows of our relationship.

54
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,875
Be very careful.

55
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,541
We'll reach Mount Wudang tomorrow.

56
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,708
It's good to take Wuji on this trip.

57
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,041
It's not fair to keep him

58
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,791
on the island.

59
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,458
Mother.

60
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,250
Wake up, Mother.

61
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,166
Don't cry.

62
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,916
What's wrong with your mother?

63
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,250
She passed out

64
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,375
and won't wake up.

65
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,041
Mother.

66
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,250
Mother.

67
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,750
May I give you something?

68
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,791
I want you to have it.

69
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,041
Thank you.

70
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,666
Mother.

71
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,708
Wake up.

72
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,083
Mother, you're awake.

73
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,125
Mother.

74
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,166
Wudang token

75
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,625
Mother.

76
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,041
You're badly hurt.

77
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,041
Here.

78
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,041
Come.

79
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,666
Put on your headscarf.

80
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,333
Let's go, Mother.

81
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,833
-Come on. Your mother will be all right.
-Where to?

82
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,208
-Come with me.
-Mother.

83
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,291
-Zhiruo.
-Mother.

84
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,875
Mother!

85
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,625
Mother!

86
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,041
Miejue

87
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:53,791
Master.

88
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,333
Zhang Cuishan

89
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,208
and Yin Susu are here.

90
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,708
Your hard work has earned my forgiveness.

91
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,166
Your sins of giving birth
out of wedlock are forgiven.

92
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,083
Thank you, Master.

93
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,125
I will take good care
of your daughter, Zhiruo.

94
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,250
Go in peace.

95
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,291
Mount Wudang

96
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,916
I, Zhang Sanfeng,

97
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,583
am celebrating my 100th birthday.

98
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,583
Please bless me,

99
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,333
so I won't have to fight anymore.

100
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,500
Mother, why did they all
come to look for Father?

101
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,833
Their excuse is to even the score

102
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:46,916
with your father,

103
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,750
but actually, they're all
after your godfather's Dragon Saber.

104
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,791
You came all the way

105
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,166
over mountains and hills.

106
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,333
Welcome.

107
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,125
All these people

108
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,333
have come to Wudang

109
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,041
to celebrate

110
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,291
my birthday.

111
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,333
Since you came

112
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,541
all the way here,

113
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,208
you must be hungry.

114
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,041
Why don't you spend some time
in Mount Wudang

115
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,708
and have a late-night snack and chat?

116
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,416
So you are afraid now.

117
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Have Zhang Cuishan
tell us where Xie Xun is

118
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,708
and it will be over.

119
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,333
Tell us now.

120
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,916
Xie Xun was framed.

121
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,416
Cheng Kun is the real culprit.

122
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,208
You pride yourselves
on being the righteous clan.

123
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,541
You say you want revenge,

124
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,291
but all you really want
is to seize the Dragon Saber.

125
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,791
Xie Xun and Yin Susu

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,833
are the hall master and witch
of the evil cult.

127
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,458
Your relationship with them

128
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,541
has tainted the reputation
of all Six Sects.

129
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:46,750
Today,

130
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,750
you're given a chance to repent.

131
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,750
Tell us where Xie Xun is

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,625
and divorce the witch Yin Susu.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,833
Perhaps

134
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,541
we'll consider forgiving you.

135
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,208
Which one of you is qualified
to talk about right and wrong?

136
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,500
Cuishan.

137
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,291
Be kind when you speak.
Don't be too hard on others.

138
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,375
Master Zhang,

139
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,458
you're harboring Zhang Cuishan.

140
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,250
Weapons do not bring luck.

141
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,500
Miejue, I've known you
since you were a child.

142
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,375
I know your temper.

143
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,375
I turned 100 years old today.

144
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,708
Give me a break.

145
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,208
Be forgiving.

146
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,916
At least act like it.

147
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,208
However,

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,875
if you really choose to be unreasonable

149
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,583
and insist

150
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,833
on teaching me a few moves,

151
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,208
I'm happy to oblige.

152
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,500
Xuanming Duo

153
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,041
Who are you?

154
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,583
If you want to do good for yourself,

155
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,583
just come with us.

156
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,375
Wuji, run!

157
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,625
Mother!

158
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,333
-Mother!
-Go!

159
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,958
Come down!

160
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,583
Xuanming Divine Palm?

161
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,333
My brother!

162
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,416
Let go of my brother!

163
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,791
Otherwise,

164
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,750
I'll twist off his head.

165
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:29,791
Wuji...

166
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:43,750
Hey.

167
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,166
Let's go.

168
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,750
Grandmaster, I feel so cold.

169
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,791
Wuji.

170
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,458
Wuji...

171
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,208
You call yourselves

172
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,458
the righteous clans!

173
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,333
Wuji.

174
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,541
They've been hit

175
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,750
by the Xuanming Divine Palm.

176
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,250
Master.

177
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,333
I don't want Wudang to take the blame.

178
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,916
I will face this alone.

179
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,958
I can never repay you

180
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,083
for all you have taught me.

181
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,416
Please promise me one thing.

182
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,375
Take care of Susu

183
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,375
and Wuji.

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,916
Father!

185
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,166
Grandmaster.

186
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,500
I, Zhang Cuishan,

187
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,541
officially leave Wudang today.

188
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,958
Those of you
who want to hunt down Xie Xun for revenge,

189
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,958
do it now.

190
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,166
-My fellow brothers, don't try to help me.
-Cuishan!

191
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,291
Go.

192
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,708
Don't be distracted.

193
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,708
The Heavenly Sword.

194
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:39,833
Master.

195
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,666
-Cuishan!
-Father!

196
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,333
-Master.
-Master.

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,833
Let go!

198
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:12,916
Father!

199
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,083
Father.

200
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,291
-Cuishan.
-Father!

201
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,416
Cuishan.

202
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,625
Father.

203
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:49,875
Father.

204
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,416
Hereafter,

205
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,375
live on and be well.

206
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,458
Don't avenge me.

207
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,291
If the Heavenly Sword

208
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,916
remains in the possession
of people like you,

209
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,541
countless innocents will be harmed.

210
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,250
To give a face

211
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,083
to your grandmaster,

212
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,875
the heroine Guo Xiang,

213
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,000
I will spare you today.

214
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:09,791
Get out!

215
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,625
All of you, get out!

216
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,791
Master.

217
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,666
How is Wuji's injury?

218
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,541
Unfortunately,

219
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,291
I'm only 20 to 30% proficient

220
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,833
in the Great Yang Stance.

221
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,916
Back then, I mistakenly copied

222
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,541
a scripture
at Shaolin Temple's scripture library

223
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,958
for my master,

224
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,083
known as Lengqie Mantra.

225
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,708
Lengqie Mantra

226
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,166
is the mental essence

227
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,375
of the Great Yang Stance.

228
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,916
Shaolin accused us
of stealing their kung fu.

229
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,625
They ran us out as traitors.

230
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,500
Before my master died,

231
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,000
he made me swear

232
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,041
that no Wudang disciple

233
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,666
shall learn Lengqie Mantra.

234
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,416
Only by learning
the completed Great Yang Stance

235
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,166
can Wuji be saved.

236
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,375
But Lengqie Mantra is in Shaolin.

237
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,666
What can we do?

238
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,541
Let me think.

239
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,000
Wuji.

240
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,208
Yes.

241
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,750
This is the scripture library.

242
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,625
No one may enter.

243
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,041
You and your mother

244
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,416
may recuperate here.

245
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,416
Yes, Grandmaster.

246
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,583
Read some scriptures

247
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,625
and tidy them up for me.

248
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,416
At the bell,

249
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,708
go to the dining hall.

250
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,791
Grandmaster!

251
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,375
Lengqie Mantra

252
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,833
Lankavatara-sutra

253
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,083
Grandmaster said

254
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,583
Wudang disciples
are not allowed to read this.

255
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,958
But I'm not a Wudang disciple.

256
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,125
Looking for a seat? Sit here with me.

257
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,500
Come over here.

258
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,666
Sit.

259
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,625
Song Qingshu

260
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,291
You piece of trash.

261
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,791
You wasted Grandmaster's energy

262
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,333
and now you're grabbing a free meal?

263
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,708
If I were you,

264
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,500
I'd rather scuttle out of here
as far away as possible,

265
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,083
then curl up and die in a cave

266
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,125
than embarrass everyone.

267
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,208
Who are you?

268
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,208
Me?

269
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,708
I am your father.

270
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,791
Wuji.

271
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,625
Come here.

272
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,541
Don't argue with your seniors.

273
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,708
Let's go.

274
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,166
You and your mother
should get way out of here.

275
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,125
Stop freeloading in Wudang.

276
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,875
Go back to your mother's evil cult.

277
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,083
After all,

278
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,083
she's a witch.

279
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,166
That makes you a witch's seed.

280
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,833
You can bad-mouth me,

281
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,083
but don't bad-mouth my mother!

282
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,916
So what if we do?

283
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,750
Stop fighting.

284
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,416
-Stop fighting!
-Wuji!

285
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,208
Stop.

286
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,041
Stop it!

287
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,125
Mother!

288
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:32,708
Stop fighting!

289
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,875
Seven-Wound Punch!

290
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,750
Mother, let's go.

291
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,125
Are you all right?

292
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,583
-Master.
-Master.

293
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:10,916
There's some bad news.

294
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,291
-Has the chill toxin hit again?
-No.

295
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,541
He was in the dining hall

296
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,166
and he wounded
all the third generation disciples,

297
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,458
including Qingshu.

298
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:18,666
The kung fu he used

299
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,666
was Xie Xun's

300
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,041
Seven-Wound Punch.

301
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,916
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

302
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,750
Wuji.

303
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,208
-Come here.
-Mother.

304
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,750
Mother.

305
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,625
I won't make it
back to the Island with you.

306
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:12,666
That's not true.

307
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,041
You will make it back with me.

308
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,500
Remember to give

309
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,416
the Lengqie Mantra to your godfather.

310
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,666
With his intelligence,

311
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,833
he will figure it out.

312
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,041
When that happens,

313
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,416
the chill toxin in your body
will be cured.

314
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,958
When I have mastered the skill,

315
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,291
I will avenge you both.

316
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,125
No.

317
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,500
Do not think of revenge

318
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,791
or that cycle will never end.

319
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,416
Remember.

320
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,708
What others call

321
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,458
evil cult or witchcraft

322
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,041
may not be true.

323
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,583
Even in the so-called upright
and respectable sects,

324
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,041
there are despicable people.

325
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,125
You must see clearly.

326
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,666
You...

327
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,666
You must remember that.

328
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,666
Mother.

329
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:16,500
Mother.

330
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,208
Mother!

331
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:19,625
Mother!

332
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,875
Mother.

333
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,291
Wuji returned alone to Ice Fire Island

334
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,208
and under Xie Xun's guidance,

335
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,791
he found,
between the lines of Lengqie Mantra,

336
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,583
were the principles
of the Great Yang Stance.

337
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,416
After practicing for about six months,

338
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,083
Wuji is cured of all his chill toxins.

339
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,958
But to master the Great Yang Stance,

340
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:22,625
he practiced for a further 16 years

341
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,916
to attain ultimate power.

342
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,833
He decided to return to the Central Plains

343
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,666
to avenge his parents.

344
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,708
Seventeen years later

345
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:54,166
Back then,

346
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,416
we, as the Five Major Sects,
went to Wudang

347
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,583
to ask Zhang Cuishan and his wife
for that person.

348
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,208
He refused

349
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,250
but couldn't live with it
and killed himself.

350
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,208
What about Yin Susu?

351
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,708
She was even more absurd.

352
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:10,291
She wanted to come with us to Huashan

353
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,333
and be our wife.

354
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,583
Hearing that, I slapped her.

355
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,708
She was such a shameless woman.

356
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,541
Then she killed herself.

357
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:20,833
So this time,

358
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,375
the four hall masters of the evil sect
and the Left and Right Emissaries

359
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:24,750
must give in and kowtow to you.

360
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,666
Of course.

361
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,333
And if the kowtows aren't loud enough,

362
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,000
I may not let him go.

363
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,416
-Who was that?
-Who?

364
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,541
How dare you bully us, the Huashan Elders?

365
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,458
Who is it?

366
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,000
Who was it?

367
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,041
Who was it?

368
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:45,833
-Come out!
-Come out!

369
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,208
How dare you insult the Wudang Hero,
Zhang Cuishan,

370
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,083
and daughter of the Eagle King?

371
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,375
All I did was
throw eggs and tomatoes at you.

372
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,083
I consider that very polite already.

373
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:07,250
Little girl,

374
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,291
are you with the Ming Sect?

375
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,541
I am the one

376
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,291
who will soon make you kowtow soon.

377
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,333
I'm Left Emissary of the Ming Sect,

378
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,500
Yang Xiao's

379
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,916
youngest and most useless servant.

380
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,916
You two fatties,
didn't you claim your kung fu is awesome?

381
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,291
If you could catch me,
then your kung fu is really awesome.

382
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,125
-Go after her!
-Yes.

383
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,500
-Go!
-Go!

384
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,208
This way.

385
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,375
Over there.

386
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:37,291
Over there.

387
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:09,375
Who is that?

388
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,958
Who are you?

389
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,375
Why did you suddenly

390
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,625
show up to rescue me?

391
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,000
You're just a servant of the Ming Sect.
Why act on a rash impulse?

392
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,333
You know you are outnumbered,

393
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,791
so why did you still agitate
the Huashan Elders?

394
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,291
They were speaking ill of Ms. Yin.

395
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:35,666
She may be dead,
but they were making up stories about her.

396
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,666
That is unacceptable.

397
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,208
You work for Yang Xiao,
Ming Sect's Left Emissary?

398
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,750
I'm just his youngest,

399
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,833
most useless servant.

400
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,500
Hurry back to Ming Sect.

401
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,500
If you meet others
from the Six Major Sects,

402
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,250
you'll be brought in for interrogation.

403
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,875
I must fulfill my mission

404
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,041
before I go back.

405
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,708
What must you do?

406
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:02,375
You're such a strange person.

407
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,208
Do you think
just because you saved my life,

408
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,416
you can ask me anything?

409
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,541
I don't even know your name.

410
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,583
I'm Zeng A'niu. You?

411
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:14,791
I'm Xiao Zhao.

412
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,041
Since you saved me,

413
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:17,250
have a candy.

414
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,625
Here.

415
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:20,541
Thank you.

416
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,375
What kind of person
can get the Xuanming Duo to be his guard?

417
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,083
Zeng A'niu, we'll meet again.

418
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,250
You've worked for my father
for over a decade,

419
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,708
vowed to get him the Dragon Saber
and the Heavenly Sword,

420
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:48,958
unify the martial world,

421
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,375
and destroy all anti-imperial forces.

422
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:52,500
You do have some guts.

423
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:53,958
These few years...

424
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,791
Down there
are all top-notch kung fu masters.

425
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,000
-I've got the Six Sects to obey me.
-Get out.

426
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,166
It's you again.

427
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,250
The coordinated attack on Ming Sect
has been planned for three years.

428
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,958
In recent years, the Ming Sect
has been the biggest imperial rebel.

429
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,750
I tried to foment dispute
between the Six Major Sects and Ming Sect,

430
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,375
causing casualties on both sides.

431
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,916
Then we can break them one by one

432
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,125
and the deed will be done.

433
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,583
You've been working undercover
in Shaolin for ten years.

434
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Have you stolen the Indestructible Vajra

435
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,958
which is supposed to be
the top of the 72 Invincible Skills?

436
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,125
Your Highness, I will try my best.

437
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,416
Trying your best is useless.

438
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,541
I want to win!

439
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:30,083
Understood.

440
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,500
Good.

441
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,166
Get out.

442
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,333
Did you hear that?

443
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,791
I knew it.

444
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,583
-I want them alive.
-Yes.

445
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,291
Beat him up, Zeng A'niu!

446
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,541
Give him a good beating.

447
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,250
This kid

448
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,750
has incredible internal power.

449
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,250
Young hero,

450
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,000
are you with the Ming Sect

451
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,250
or the Six Major Sects?

452
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,583
So the decade-long conflicts
in the martial world

453
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,083
are all your doing.

454
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,541
Your Highness,

455
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,958
this brat must die.

456
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,375
Your Highness!

457
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,250
Leave, all of you!

458
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

459
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,166
This hero will not harm me.

460
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:52,625
How did you know

461
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,250
I would catch your little girlfriend

462
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,000
and not kill her?

463
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,958
You're not evil.

464
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,250
Me being evil or not

465
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,750
is not up to you.

466
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,458
You may take your little girlfriend now.

467
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,416
She has been hit by Xuanming Divine Palm.

468
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,083
Enjoy your final moments together.

469
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,500
Go after them!

470
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,708
Don't bother.

471
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,541
Your Highness.

472
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,083
He is a martial arts master.

473
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,416
He is likely to ruin our plans.

474
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,916
Are you able to kill him?

475
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,166
I have my ideas.

476
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,250
Benny.

477
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,833
What are you thinking?

478
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,166
Why do you call me Benny?

479
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,750
You saved my life.

480
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,333
I was going

481
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,208
to call you Benefactor,

482
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,791
but that

483
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,833
sounds a bit old.

484
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,666
Benny seems appropriate.

485
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,125
Don't talk so much.

486
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,083
You've been hit by Xuanming Divine Palms.

487
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,083
Let's go to Ming Sect.

488
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,500
It's the safest place.

489
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,250
And we must tell

490
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,833
Left Emissary Yang
about the bad guys' schemes.

491
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,833
Go to Ming Sect.

492
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:42,041
Only those in the Ming Sect
can defend against the Six Major Sects.

493
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,708
I'm...

494
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:50,833
I am so cold.

495
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,625
Is your sister ill?

496
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,291
My sister?

497
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,666
We're rushing back
to our home village to have her cured.

498
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,541
May I give you something?

499
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,083
Thank you.

500
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:25,500
Miss.

501
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,583
The gem on your belt...

502
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,166
You mean this?

503
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,250
This piece of amber

504
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,458
was given to me by a boy

505
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,000
when I was a child.

506
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,708
-Careful.
-Be careful.

507
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,833
We're heading towards Ming Sect.

508
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:53,750
Where are you headed?

509
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,708
We're going to the base of Ming Sect.

510
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:58,833
That's on our way.

511
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,708
You can share our carriage
and travel with us.

512
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,541
Wonderful. Thank you, miss.

513
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,458
-I...
-Quiet.

514
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,125
We have a ride. Come on.

515
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,625
Sir.

516
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,000
I didn't get your name.

517
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,541
I am Zeng A'niu.

518
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,791
My sister is Zeng A'bao.

519
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,916
Your sister...

520
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,208
What illness does she have?

521
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,625
I don't know.

522
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,333
She keeps complaining that she's cold.

523
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And your senior?

524
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,750
She seems to have burns.

525
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,541
We are from Emei Sect.

526
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:41,791
While fighting
with Ming Sect's Fire Branch,

527
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:44,541
she was ambushed

528
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,000
and got burned.

529
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:51,458
She lost. That's all. Why lie about it?

530
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,958
I'm having a headache.

531
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,833
There she goes again.

532
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,125
Perhaps my master

533
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,166
can help your sister with her illness.

534
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,208
Thank you,

535
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,166
but our home remedies
work pretty well too.

536
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:20,750
Zhiruo.

537
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,375
We're approaching
the sects' gathering camp.

538
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,416
Mr. Zeng,

539
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:35,791
see you.

540
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:43,666
A'niu,

541
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,083
are you missing her?

542
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,166
What?

543
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:50,791
Back in the carriage,

544
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:51,916
you couldn't

545
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,500
take your eyes off that Ms. Zhou.

546
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,625
What are you blabbering about?

547
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,291
Only you would know

548
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,958
if I was blabbering.

549
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:03,416
Sir.

550
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,541
-Let's go.
-Yes.

551
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
The Heavenly Sword
is now returned to its owner.

552
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,833
I hope Wudang and Emei

553
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,333
will preserve righteousness
in the martial world

554
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
and fight evil together.

555
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,291
Master Zhang is an elder we highly honor.

556
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,416
As descendants,
we respectfully obey his teachings.

557
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,041
Now, the Six Major Sects
have joined forces

558
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,250
to besiege Ming Sect

559
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,333
and destroy the evil cult.

560
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,416
This is a battle we cannot afford to lose.

561
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,583
Wudang and Emei have
set aside their differences.

562
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,291
That's a good thing for the martial world.

563
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,833
Hereafter, we must unite
in hearts and minds

564
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,125
to destroy evil beings.

565
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,125
Master.

566
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,583
I've found out

567
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,875
that in Ming Sect,

568
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:47,708
apart from Left Emissary Yang,

569
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,750
there is also White Brows Eagle King,
Yin Tianzheng,

570
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,875
and Qingyi Bat King, Wei Yixiao,

571
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,458
who would come back to defend the sect.

572
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:56,041
Plus the Five Elements Forces,

573
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,083
we're in for a hard battle.

574
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,333
That's all there is to it.

575
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,708
We killed a dozen from the Fire Branch.

576
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,666
But seven or eight of yours
were killed as well

577
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,583
-and one got burned.
-Yes.

578
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:09,916
What is that supposed to mean?

579
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,333
I'm trying to think of an all-around plan

580
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,666
so that while destroying the Cult,

581
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,791
the Six Sects
don't suffer heavy casualties.

582
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,541
-That wouldn't be a good deal.
-Yes.

583
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,708
You're right.

584
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,791
What are your thoughts?

585
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,791
Let's play dirty.

586
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,708
We'll ambush
some of their kung fu experts,

587
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:30,375
then winning them will be easy.

588
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,166
How do we ambush them?

589
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,333
Well...

590
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,500
You tell them.

591
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:37,625
You tell them.

592
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:44,916
Everyone.

593
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,041
Zhang Cuishan had a son, Zhang Wuji,

594
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
who was later lost.

595
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,833
He is White Brows Eagle King's grandson.

596
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,625
If he suddenly shows up,

597
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,125
the White Brows Eagle King
will let his guard down.

598
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:57,416
You make it sound so easy.

599
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,666
Where can we find Zhang Wuji?
Shall I pretend to be him?

600
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,541
Exactly. Who can be the impostor?

601
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,625
I think Master Song's son

602
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,208
is the best choice.

603
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:07,416
Father.

604
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,041
That's not a bad idea.

605
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:11,041
Well...

606
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,333
So when all the so-called
righteous sects get together,

607
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,583
all they think about are dirty tricks.

608
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,125
My wife!

609
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:35,458
Vampire Bat.

610
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,583
Let go of my wife now.

611
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,625
This fatty hasn't taken a bath.

612
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,041
There's no way I'm sucking her blood.

613
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,041
Sword!

614
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,333
Dear!

615
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:52,875
Dear!

616
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:21,083
Don't let him get away.

617
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:33,166
This girl smells much better.

618
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,166
I want to suck up all your blood.

619
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,375
Good kung fu!

620
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,041
Mr. Zeng.

621
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,041
Are you injured?

622
00:43:10,666 --> 00:43:11,708
Let go of her.

623
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,083
Who are you?

624
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:27,458
Friend or enemy?

625
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:30,000
My name

626
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,375
is unimportant.

627
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,208
-Goodbye.
-You may not leave.

628
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:36,250
You're not with any major sect,
yet you have such advanced skills.

629
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,750
Perhaps you have colluded
with the Cult monsters

630
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:40,250
to gain our trust.

631
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,541
I have no such intention.

632
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,750
Explain yourself before you go.

633
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,250
Everyone,

634
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:45,875
my sister's illness

635
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,458
cannot wait any longer.

636
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,833
I beg your pardon.

637
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,083
Where did he go?

638
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,000
Xiao Zhao.

639
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,208
The chill toxin is attacking.

640
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,208
-Over there. Go after him.
-Where is he?

641
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:16,208
Hang on.

642
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,833
That brat must be related to Xie Xun.

643
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,250
What are you smiling about?

644
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,291
No, Master.

645
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,541
I...

646
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,833
I was smiling at his cowardice.

647
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,958
He ran away
with his tail between his legs.

648
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,750
This conspiracy of the Six Major Sects
besieging Ming Sect

649
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,333
must be supported
by a dark Imperial force.

650
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:48,958
Is it true?

651
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,000
King Yuyang has sent Princess Zhao Min

652
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,875
to manipulate the martial world
in the Central Plains.

653
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,166
Eagle King. Left Emissary Yang.

654
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:06,625
I am here.

655
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,916
Bat King, it's great to have you back.

656
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,583
So we have another ally.

657
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,208
Pass down this order.

658
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,833
Whoever claims to be
Eagle King's grandson, Zhang Wuji,

659
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,750
-kill him without mercy.
-Why?

660
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,208
I was gathering intelligence
at the Six Sects' camp.

661
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:25,083
They're looking for someone
to pretend to be Zhang Wuji.

662
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,916
Despicable!

663
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:30,791
My grandson has been missing for years

664
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,750
and they use such a dirty trick.

665
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,291
Pass down my orders.

666
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:38,541
Whoever claims to be Zhang Wuji,
grandson of Eagle King,

667
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:39,958
kill him without mercy.

668
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,416
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

669
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:46,500
Someone has barged in.

670
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,208
-Xiao Zhao.
-Emissary Yang.

671
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,125
It's you again.

672
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,375
She has been hit by Xuanming Divine Palm.

673
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,125
Emissary Yang, please give us a safe place

674
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,666
so that I can help her
expel the chill toxin.

675
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,083
Years ago when Zhang Wuji was hit
by Xuanming Divine Palm,

676
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:05,333
not even Master Zhang Sanfeng
could expel it.

677
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:07,666
Who are you to claim
you are capable of that?

678
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,666
I don't have time to explain.

679
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,250
Please help us.

680
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,541
If you don't mean any harm,

681
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,458
drop off Xiao Zhao and leave now.

682
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:16,458
I can't leave her like this.

683
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,625
Stop blabbering.

684
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:18,708
Let her go!

685
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,291
Grandfather.

686
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,208
I'm Wuji.

687
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,000
Are you really Wuji?

688
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,666
Benny, come here quickly.

689
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,291
Benny, come with me.

690
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,500
I've been here for over 30 years

691
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,958
and never knew there was a trapdoor here.

692
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,375
Who is this Xiao Zhao?

693
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:47,416
An orphan whom I rescued
from the Western Regions seven years ago.

694
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,166
Behind the wall...

695
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,666
That must be our sanctum,

696
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,875
the Bright Secret Chamber.

697
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,208
Besides our chief,

698
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,125
no one else may enter.

699
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,916
Trespasser will die.

700
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,250
So even if we opened the wall,

701
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,541
we would not be able to enter.

702
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,625
That's right.

703
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:19,708
Where are we?

704
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:22,958
This is the Bright Secret Chamber.

705
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,416
Only the various chiefs of Ming Sect
over the generations

706
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,791
may enter this forbidden chamber.

707
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,583
How do you know about it?

708
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,333
My mother was a servant here
for over ten years.

709
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:35,333
She accidentally discovered it.

710
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:37,125
She kept it to herself

711
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,583
and never told anyone else

712
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,041
except me.

713
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,166
I have never been in here either.

714
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:45,375
Is there a way out?

715
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,833
I don't know.

716
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,583
Don't worry.

717
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:50,625
We'll find it.

718
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:51,708
Come.

719
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,875
Emissary Yang.

720
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,666
The Six Major Sects
have begun their attack.

721
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,000
They have numerous top-tier fighters.

722
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,208
Our men are having trouble defending.

723
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:03,375
Eagle King, every army needs a leader.

724
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:06,250
Please go downhill
to lead the Five Elements Forces

725
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,208
and be our first line of defense
against the enemies.

726
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,000
If you really cannot hold the line

727
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,291
then withdraw to the grand hall here.

728
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,125
Yes.

729
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,083
No matter who wins or loses today,

730
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,000
this is going to be a catastrophe
for the martial world.

731
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:35,458
Let's hope the undying sacred flame,

732
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:37,375
which has been lit
since the founding of the sect,

733
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:39,250
will not be extinguished in our hands.

734
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,291
About that,

735
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:43,208
there is still room for discussion.

736
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,708
Cheng Kun.

737
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,791
When did you become a monk?

738
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:52,250
About a dozen years ago,

739
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,625
I became a disciple of Shaolin
under Master Kong Wen.

740
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,500
My Buddhist name is Yuanzhen.

741
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:58,750
There's a bloody battle going on
at the bottom of the hill.

742
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,666
How did you get through
the chaos to the peak?

743
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,625
Aside from Yang Dingtian,

744
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,541
I'm one of the few people who have been
in the Bright Secret Chamber.

745
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,041
Trespassing
is a crime punishable by death.

746
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,791
That sounds awful.

747
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,166
In Ming Sect,

748
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:13,458
apart from the two of you,

749
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:16,000
only White Brows Eagle King
can be considered a top-tier fighter.

750
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,125
Whereas the Six Major Sects
have numerous good fighters.

751
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,875
Even if you take them one by one,
they'll eventually wear you out.

752
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,833
You should incapacitate yourselves,

753
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:24,041
put out your sacred flame,

754
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,750
and never mention Ming Sect again
from now on.

755
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:27,958
Then perhaps

756
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,250
we'll let you live.

757
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:32,208
How about I let you die first?

758
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,166
Aren't the Xuanming Divine Palms
devastating?

759
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,416
No need to kill them.

760
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:18,833
The toxin of the Xuanming Divine Palms

761
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:20,833
will stop them
from lifting their strengths.

762
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,916
When the Six Sects arrive,

763
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,875
they will slice off their flesh
piece by piece.

764
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:25,875
Let's go.

765
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,125
This is like a maze.

766
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:47,916
What's with you?

767
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,291
I'm eating candy.

768
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,250
Let's go.

769
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,041
The chill toxin hits again.

770
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:14,875
Just leave me alone.

771
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:17,166
Don't waste your energy on me.

772
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,125
It's crucial you find a way out.

773
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:28,708
The air feels fresh in here.

774
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:30,166
There must be an exit.

775
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,458
Wait here.

776
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,125
Benny.

777
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,583
Whose skeleton is that?

778
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,666
Maybe the writing on the bed can tell us.

779
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,666
Come here.

780
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,875
"I, Yang Dingtian,

781
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:40,083
the 33rd Chief of the Ming Sect,

782
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:42,166
had sworn to lead the Sect

783
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,500
to overturn the tyrannical government

784
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,333
and bring back the order
of the sacred flame

785
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,750
from our main altar in the west.

786
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,541
I was foolish

787
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,583
to marry an immoral woman.

788
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,500
She had a lover named Cheng Kun."

789
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:54,833
What are you doing?

790
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:11,166
I know

791
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,791
I will die soon.

792
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,791
I've carved the seven levels
of the Grand Diversion on the rock.

793
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:17,916
After I die,

794
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,375
Xie Xun will become the deputy chief

795
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,666
and whoever that can bring back
the Sacred Flame Plaques

796
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,791
will become the chief.

797
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,291
On completion of level three
of the Grand Diversion,

798
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,750
one can move the big rock
and leave the chamber.

799
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,000
These are the final words
from Yang Dingtian.

800
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,166
This writing is all curly-looking.

801
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:48,791
What language is it?

802
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:50,958
I understand that writing.

803
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,583
It describes the Grand Diversion.

804
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,083
You can learn it.

805
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,125
Xiao Zhao,

806
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,458
read it to me.

807
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:08,708
The first level is...

808
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:26,833
The second level is...

809
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:44,416
This is the third level.

810
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,958
"Those slow to understand

811
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,458
will take 20 years to learn.

812
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,916
Those quick to understand

813
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
will take ten years.

814
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,750
When one gets
to the highest state of this skill,

815
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,541
one can levitate off the ground
during meditation."

816
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,958
-Kill!
-Kill!

817
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,458
Yang Xiao. Wei Yixiao.

818
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,958
Stop playing dead.

819
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,333
Your evil cult is falling to its doom.

820
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,291
If you call yourselves men,

821
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,458
pull yourselves together
and join this old guy to fight us

822
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:55,083
and die a glorious death.

823
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:56,541
You thieving evil woman.

824
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,833
Can't I, White Brows Eagle King,

825
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,708
take you on alone?

826
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,333
If you dare, come at me one at a time.

827
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:06,333
Fine.

828
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:07,333
I'll do it.

829
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,583
-I'll...
-I'll let you guys go first.

830
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:11,666
Come on. Go ahead.

831
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,791
-Who will go first?
-The Kunlun Sect will be first.

832
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:14,791
Go!

833
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:46,458
Xiao Zhao.

834
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,041
I'm on the sixth level

835
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,166
and I have figured out how to cure you.

836
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,041
Benny.

837
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,250
Don't worry about me.

838
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:55,000
Get to the seventh level.

839
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,083
Leave me alone.

840
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:58,375
-Leave me alone, Benny.
-Xiao Zhao.

841
00:57:58,458 --> 00:57:59,291
Hurry.

842
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,916
Xiao Zhao.

843
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:28,416
Xiao Zhao.

844
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:31,291
It's over.

845
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,666
Benny.

846
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:33,916
What happened?

847
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,416
The Grand Diversion

848
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,875
can take any weapon
or internal strength directed at you

849
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,250
and shift it elsewhere,

850
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,791
even shifting it back to the enemy.

851
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,166
Your chill toxin

852
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:45,833
has been shifted
into the dead body of Chief Yang.

853
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,291
Amazing.

854
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:48,458
Benny,

855
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,458
in that case,

856
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:52,375
you should learn the seventh level

857
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,916
and you'll be invincible.

858
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,291
The sixth level
had never been achieved before me.

859
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,125
So why do I need
to learn the seventh level?

860
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:01,958
Let's get out of here.

861
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,125
The Six Major Sects

862
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,416
should be attacking Ming Sect now.

863
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,166
I must stop this disaster.

864
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:34,625
Who's next?

865
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,833
Song Yuanqiao of Wudang
along with four fellow brothers

866
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:39,500
seek to learn from the Eagle King.

867
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:40,583
Come on.

868
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:55,833
Beat him! Move.

869
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:56,875
Beat him!

870
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,750
Hats off to you.

871
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:21,833
This is

872
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:23,250
considered a tie.

873
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:24,458
Eagle King.

874
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:25,958
You're a respected hero.

875
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:28,041
We don't want to give you a hard time.

876
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,250
You can end your own life.

877
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,416
Old Monk.

878
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:32,541
You're befuddled.

879
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:34,208
We don't want
to give you a hard time either.

880
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:35,375
Just end your own life.

881
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,208
In that case,

882
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:41,875
let's attack all at once and eradicate
the last monsters of this evil cult.

883
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,125
Then extinguish
that so-called undying sacred flame.

884
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,375
Sure. Miejue.

885
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,625
You go ahead.

886
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:48,625
We'll back you up.

887
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,625
I'll kill Yang Xiao.

888
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:51,875
I'll kill Wei Yixiao.

889
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:53,333
Then we'll take all their money.

890
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,833
And grab all their women.

891
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,000
Xiao Zhao,

892
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,916
take care of them for me.

893
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:21,250
You were lucky to have escaped yesterday
and you dare show up again now.

894
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,416
Young man.

895
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,208
Are you with the Ming Sect?

896
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,208
No.

897
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:28,416
But I know that this besieging Ming Sect
by the Six Major Sects

898
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:30,791
was caused by an Imperial spy

899
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:32,250
that fomented dispute among all of you,

900
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:35,000
so the sects would kill one another

901
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:36,875
and become too weak to be enemies
of the Imperial Court.

902
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:38,958
You must not fall into that trap.

903
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,333
You say there is a spy.

904
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:42,250
-Which one is the spy?
-Who is the spy?

905
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:43,291
-Who?
-Tell us.

906
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,916
The spy I was referring to

907
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:47,958
is Shaolin's Yuanzhen.

908
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,083
His real name was Cheng Kun.

909
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,708
Why don't you get him out here
to confront us?

910
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,041
Amitābha.

911
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,666
My brother's disciple, Yuanzhen,

912
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,291
unfortunately vanished
while fighting with the Earth Branch.

913
01:01:58,375 --> 01:01:59,833
How dare you sully his name.

914
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,041
I saw it myself.

915
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:06,208
He, the Xuanming Duo, and the Princess
were discussing today's attack.

916
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,958
Their aim is for the Ming Sect
and Six Major Sects to be weakened

917
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,125
through all the disputes

918
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,875
so that they can destroy them one by one.

919
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,416
Benny.

920
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,333
Their chill toxins are attacking.

921
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:23,583
Young man,

922
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,375
are you with the Ming Sect?

923
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,333
If so,

924
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:28,416
I will butcher you
into eight pieces right now.

925
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:30,541
You two squealing pigs.

926
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:31,791
Shut up

927
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,125
or I'll make

928
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,833
bacon out of you.

929
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:35,875
Little girl,

930
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:38,125
you are so thin.

931
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:39,041
Do not fear.

932
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,916
After I kill your brother,

933
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,291
we'll take you to Huashan

934
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:46,666
and feed you until you're plump
like him, all right?

935
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:54,916
What is he doing?

936
01:03:02,041 --> 01:03:03,541
Do you feel cold?

937
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:04,666
Nice and cool.

938
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,291
Sirs, please take a rest.

939
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,958
You'll recover in an hour.

940
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,708
Thank you, young hero.

941
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,250
We'll take a break.

942
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:14,250
Take a break.

943
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,166
I feel so cold.

944
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:17,500
Why did everyone stop

945
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,250
when this brat showed up?

946
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:21,291
If no one will take him down,

947
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,083
allow me.

948
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:28,125
Monk Kong Xing.

949
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:29,958
My senior.

950
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,500
Let me do this for Shaolin.

951
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:34,875
Master.

952
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,208
Why would Shaolin have such a fierce monk?

953
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:39,291
His skill at the Dragon Claw

954
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:41,458
has been the best
in the last ten generations or so.

955
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:43,625
Even when in training,
he would easily injure others.

956
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:44,708
So normally,

957
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,333
he would put on shackles

958
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,916
to avoid killing innocents.

959
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:50,708
Brat.

960
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:52,625
State your name.

961
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:53,791
I am Zeng A'niu.

962
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,875
I have no intention of sparring with you.

963
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:56,916
Mr. Zeng,

964
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,000
the Six Major Sects will obey you

965
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,250
if you can defeat all of us one by one

966
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:02,666
in the name of Ming Sect.

967
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,500
Otherwise, we won't oblige.

968
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:06,375
Then please pardon me.

969
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:38,875
Why is he

970
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:41,416
willing to fight for us?

971
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,458
I think we may have

972
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:45,333
misjudged him.

973
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:26,625
But why hasn't he made a move?

974
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:28,625
Don't worry.

975
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:31,208
He is observing Kong Xing

976
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:32,791
to see how many moves he is capable of.

977
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:52,791
Are you fighting or playing tag?

978
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,208
All right.

979
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:55,833
Here I come.

980
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,208
You brat.

981
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,500
When did you learn my Dragon Claw?

982
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,791
Thank you for letting me win.

983
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:41,333
I accept defeat.

984
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:43,833
That was impressive.

985
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:51,708
My senior.

986
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,833
I failed to help Shaolin.

987
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,041
I'm sorry.

988
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:06,625
Let's see if you're capable

989
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:08,500
of learning our Emei swordplay.

990
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,041
Miejue was the one that killed Father,

991
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,250
but I must not injure her today

992
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,708
or the hatred between us
won't be resolved.

993
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,083
What should I do?

994
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,208
Even if you don't use weapons,

995
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,958
I won't take it easy on you.

996
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,291
Sect Leader Miejue,

997
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,041
please enlighten me.

998
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:29,416
No matter what weapon you use,

999
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,750
you won't defeat Master's Heavenly Sword.

1000
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:32,791
Silence.

1001
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,916
I'll use you then.

1002
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,083
Put me down.

1003
01:07:59,125 --> 01:07:59,958
Master!

1004
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:05,208
Let go!

1005
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:13,375
Zhiruo.

1006
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,291
Master!

1007
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,250
Kill him!

1008
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:23,125
Ms. Zhiruo, I beg your pardon.

1009
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,166
Watch out.

1010
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,166
-Master.
-Master.

1011
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,125
Sect Leader Miejue.

1012
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,208
Thank you for letting me win.

1013
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,375
Ms. Zhiruo,

1014
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,875
please return this precious sword

1015
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,333
to your honorable master.

1016
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:11,166
Kill him!

1017
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,625
Any Emei disciple

1018
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,458
who disobeys her master

1019
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,416
will die a horrible death.

1020
01:11:24,291 --> 01:11:25,291
Benny!

1021
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,416
This gentleman is injured
while defending Ming Sect.

1022
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,666
If you still wish to fight,

1023
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,375
we will be glad to oblige.

1024
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,875
-My brothers, retreat!
-Let's go.

1025
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:04,125
Let's go.

1026
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,500
Go...

1027
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,125
Let's go.

1028
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:13,291
Let's go.

1029
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:20,708
This medicine

1030
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:23,166
was made by my master,
the honorable Zhang Sanfeng.

1031
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,791
It is excellent for cuts and bruises.

1032
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,916
If you don't mind,
it will quickly stop the bleeding.

1033
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:29,541
How would we know it's not poison?

1034
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:32,000
Wudang disciples
are always open and honest.

1035
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,083
Bat King.

1036
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:36,375
Benny!

1037
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,500
Benny!

1038
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,958
My second uncle would never hurt me.

1039
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:43,750
You're Wuji?

1040
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,250
You really are Wuji.

1041
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:48,875
Uncle.

1042
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:49,875
You've grown.

1043
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,166
I didn't recognize you.

1044
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:55,875
My senior, Wuji is alive!

1045
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,041
Hello, my uncles.

1046
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,041
How is Grandmaster?

1047
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:15,625
He is doing very well.

1048
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,125
He misses you every day.

1049
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,791
If you have the chance,

1050
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:22,416
you should go see him.

1051
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:23,791
I will.

1052
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:29,541
-Benny.
-Wuji.

1053
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:30,666
-Benny!
-Wuji!

1054
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:31,875
Wuji.

1055
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:32,875
Wuji.

1056
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:34,958
We should go

1057
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,791
or the other sects will think
we are colluding with the Ming Sect.

1058
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,083
-Let's go.
-Please take care of him.

1059
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:43,916
-We'll leave Wuji in your good hands.
-Let's go.

1060
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,833
Thank you.

1061
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:57,125
-Ming Sect forever!
-Ming Sect forever!

1062
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,333
Wuji.

1063
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:13,333
Wuji.

1064
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,000
My good grandson.

1065
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:18,083
It's all my fault.

1066
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,541
I came too late

1067
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,375
to save you from being injured.

1068
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:25,000
I'm fine.

1069
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,625
I...

1070
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:29,458
I can still take it.

1071
01:14:31,791 --> 01:14:32,625
Benny.

1072
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,541
You're finally awake.

1073
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:38,083
You've slept
for three days and three nights.

1074
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,500
Have some water.

1075
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:48,250
We hope you will help
to save the Ming Sect one more time.

1076
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,375
As long as I can do it,

1077
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:53,958
I will.

1078
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,333
You have rescued the entire Ming Sect.

1079
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,708
You are such a noble person.

1080
01:14:58,791 --> 01:14:59,833
All of us

1081
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,125
would like to make you

1082
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:03,416
the 34th Chief of the Ming Sect.

1083
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,375
Please get up.

1084
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,333
Grandfather, please stand up.

1085
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:10,666
Chief commands us to get up.

1086
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:13,333
-We obey the Chief's command.
-We obey the Chief's command.

1087
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,833
One month later

1088
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,291
The Chief protects the sect

1089
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:00,375
for ages to come.

1090
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:01,916
The Chief protects the sect

1091
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,291
for ages to come.

1092
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,875
The Chief protects the sect

1093
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:06,250
for ages to come.

1094
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:07,833
The Chief protects the sect

1095
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:09,083
for ages to come.

1096
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,416
The Chief protects the sect

1097
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:12,125
for ages to come.

1098
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:13,458
The Chief protects the sect

1099
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:14,916
for ages to come.

1100
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,333
-A message!
-The Chief Protects the sect

1101
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:18,958
-A message!
-for ages to come.

1102
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:31,708
Emissary Yang.

1103
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:33,583
What's wrong?

1104
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:35,708
Our spy found Swordsman Yin of Wudang

1105
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:37,250
about 60 miles south of here.

1106
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:38,750
He's badly injured.

1107
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:40,791
All his joints have been shattered.

1108
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:54,916
Uncle.

1109
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:06,458
What happened?

1110
01:17:07,875 --> 01:17:09,166
My senior and fellow brothers

1111
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,583
have all been captured.

1112
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:13,666
On the way,

1113
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:14,958
my fellow brothers

1114
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,583
suddenly felt strengthless.

1115
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:18,666
They must have been poisoned.

1116
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,750
Just then,

1117
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:22,333
two persons called Cat and Dog appeared.

1118
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,375
Cat

1119
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:26,291
shattered all the joints

1120
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:28,500
in my body.

1121
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:30,916
Don't worry, Uncle.

1122
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:33,166
I will go everywhere in the world

1123
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:34,958
to look for good physicians to cure you.

1124
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,583
Uncle.

1125
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,541
It must be someone in the Imperial Court.

1126
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:48,791
The beautiful princess.

1127
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:49,958
Do you still remember her?

1128
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,250
We followed her to Green Willow Mansion.

1129
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:53,625
It's very close from here.

1130
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,333
Green Willow Mansion?

1131
01:17:56,458 --> 01:17:57,333
Xiao Zhao.

1132
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,125
Take care of my uncle for me.

1133
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:20,083
My master knew you would come today,

1134
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:21,250
but she had to go out.

1135
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,291
So she told me to greet you heroes here.

1136
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,875
Please come in.

1137
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,083
This way, please.

1138
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:34,875
Please enjoy the snacks.

1139
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:36,250
My master will return shortly.

1140
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,333
The master knew we would come

1141
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:48,583
yet purposely left.

1142
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,958
"Destroy Huashan."

1143
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:08,208
"Defeat Kunlun."

1144
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,875
"Torture Ming Sect."

1145
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:14,291
I'll torture you first.

1146
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:18,583
-Let's go. Run!
-Grandfather.

1147
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:47,291
Chief.

1148
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,583
That powder is colorless and tasteless,

1149
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,291
but soon after inhaling it,

1150
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:54,083
I can no longer raise my inner strength.

1151
01:19:54,666 --> 01:19:55,916
I feel sore all over.

1152
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:57,833
I think

1153
01:19:58,041 --> 01:19:59,583
that's a very powerful poison.

1154
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,083
I feel the same way.

1155
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,125
Benny.

1156
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:04,500
What should we do?

1157
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:07,041
Wuji.

1158
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:09,500
The poison they inhaled

1159
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:12,000
sounds exactly like my fellow brothers'.

1160
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,625
There is no choice.

1161
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,000
I'll go back to Green Willow Mansion
to look for the princess

1162
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:20,541
and make her hand over the antidote.

1163
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,000
Xiao Zhao, take care of them.

1164
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,958
Benny,

1165
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:27,500
can't you use the Grand Diversion

1166
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:29,416
to suck out this poison?

1167
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,291
Internal injuries can be shifted,

1168
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,500
but not poisoned, I'm afraid.

1169
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,250
Benny, don't worry.

1170
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,708
I'll protect everyone with my life.

1171
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:43,666
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1172
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,541
Mr. Zhang.

1173
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,916
I thought I wouldn't get the chance
to see you again.

1174
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,291
You're full of tricks.

1175
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:30,875
Aren't you afraid
I'll kill you in a single blow?

1176
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,791
You're an extraordinary man.

1177
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:35,083
You wouldn't bully a vulnerable woman.

1178
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,250
You're no vulnerable woman.

1179
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:40,125
You are in command of the Xuanming Duo,
the Eight Amazing Archers,

1180
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:41,958
and the so-called Cat and Dog.

1181
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,708
Which imperial royalty are you?

1182
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:47,583
I'm Princess Minmin Temuer,

1183
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,958
daughter of King Ruyang.

1184
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,541
I have a Chinese name,

1185
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:54,875
Zhao Min.

1186
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:59,041
So you are second in command.

1187
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,750
And you have hidden talents.

1188
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,083
Last we met, you were nothing
but quick as a whip,

1189
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,666
you have turned
into the all powerful and influential

1190
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:11,333
Chief of Ming Sect
and enemy of the Imperial Court.

1191
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,416
Give me the antidote.

1192
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:13,375
Am I stupid?

1193
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:16,416
Would I poison them and just hand in
the antidote upon your request?

1194
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,250
Let's talk business.

1195
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:21,625
I don't make deals with those
that have differing principles.

1196
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,500
Are you thinking of robbing it from me?

1197
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,000
I'm no match for you.

1198
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:41,375
Here it is.

1199
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,625
Witch, you're tricking me again.

1200
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,041
Since I'm a witch,

1201
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,166
of course I'd play tricks.

1202
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:58,958
I'm no match for you in terms of kung fu.
But I can't just let you bully me, can I?

1203
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:01,541
Give me the antidote
and open the trap door.

1204
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,500
The antidote has been in your hand.

1205
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:12,458
The doors can only be opened
from the outside.

1206
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:31,250
Don't make me give you a hard time.

1207
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:32,541
Sure.

1208
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,416
While I'm having a hard time here,

1209
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:37,333
your little servant lover
will have a hard time out there.

1210
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,083
Let's see who has a harder time.

1211
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:40,541
What do you mean?

1212
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,958
Miejue has been lured

1213
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:46,083
to your little girlfriend

1214
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,166
and your stupid men.

1215
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,125
Miejue will not let them off easily.

1216
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,250
You're evil.

1217
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,458
Where is the person

1218
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:05,041
who just provoked us?

1219
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:15,625
It seems

1220
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,458
they've been injured or poisoned.

1221
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,625
God is fair.

1222
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,625
I'm finally given the chance to kill them.

1223
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,333
Xiao Zhao.

1224
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:33,208
Madam Miejue.

1225
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:35,708
I see you're in the mood
for an outing too.

1226
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:38,791
Benny has gone to buy a goat.

1227
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:39,916
He'll be back soon.

1228
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,416
That brat has probably died
from that stab.

1229
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:43,500
Died?

1230
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,166
He's doing very well

1231
01:24:45,291 --> 01:24:46,583
and living with gusto.

1232
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:49,791
If you don't believe me,
just wait here and see.

1233
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,625
Don't listen to her. She's bluffing.

1234
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:54,291
Watch me tear your mouth out.

1235
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:55,708
Tear my mouth out?

1236
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,208
You're not qualified yet.

1237
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:00,916
If I want to fight,
I'd fight with Madam Miejue,

1238
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,083
not with you.

1239
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,791
Three blows. Is it fine with you?

1240
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:09,791
The girl is trying to buy us time
with her life.

1241
01:25:11,916 --> 01:25:13,458
I had underestimated her.

1242
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,333
Since you want to die so badly,

1243
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:16,833
I'll send you on your way.

1244
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:33,791
Master, she is dead!

1245
01:25:46,166 --> 01:25:47,208
No, I'm not.

1246
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:52,125
What do you want?

1247
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:55,458
Look who's talking.

1248
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,125
Hurry, please.

1249
01:25:58,708 --> 01:25:59,791
Honestly,

1250
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,291
I don't know yet.

1251
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:03,000
What should I do then?

1252
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,750
I have already given you the antidote.

1253
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,958
I was going to give you

1254
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:09,250
the miracle bone medicine,

1255
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:10,583
Black Jade Ointment,

1256
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,666
for Swordsman Yin's wounds.

1257
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:15,791
But what can you give me in exchange?

1258
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:43,583
If I failed to stop your fall,

1259
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,750
your brains would be all over the floor.

1260
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,041
I'm not afraid.

1261
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:50,416
Again then.

1262
01:26:58,083 --> 01:26:59,250
I'll kill myself now.

1263
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,708
You'd better let go.

1264
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:23,875
Let me out now.

1265
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:26,458
Fine.

1266
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,916
But

1267
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,875
promise you'll do three things for me

1268
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,791
and I'll give you
the Black Jade Ointment now

1269
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:32,833
and let you go.

1270
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,708
What three things?

1271
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:37,875
I haven't thought of them yet.

1272
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,125
But

1273
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,750
I won't ask you to kill yourself

1274
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:42,708
or do anything

1275
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,208
against the principles of chivalry.

1276
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:45,583
All right?

1277
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:48,250
Fine.

1278
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,250
Master, she is dead.

1279
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:24,958
You're a zombie!

1280
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:27,500
I'm still not dead.

1281
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,041
Master!

1282
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,416
-Master!
-Master!

1283
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:48,083
Benny.

1284
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:50,333
You did well.

1285
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:53,750
I tried my best.

1286
01:29:05,916 --> 01:29:06,750
Grandfather.

1287
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:07,916
I got the antidote.

1288
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:11,083
Chief.

1289
01:29:11,541 --> 01:29:12,708
Are you sure it's real?

1290
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:14,500
I made her take two doses from there.

1291
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:15,666
The medicine is real.

1292
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:16,833
How did you get it?

1293
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:18,625
Chief has a way with women.

1294
01:29:19,083 --> 01:29:20,000
Don't worry.

1295
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:33,375
Stay back.

1296
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,250
I won't let you hurt my master.

1297
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:36,500
I just want to tell you

1298
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,875
that the Imperial Court
has sent expert fighters

1299
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,166
to kill the Six Major Sects
who left Ming Sect.

1300
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:42,708
Wudang Sect has been ambushed.

1301
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:44,541
My sixth uncle

1302
01:29:44,958 --> 01:29:46,083
is gravely injured.

1303
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,541
My four other uncles

1304
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:49,666
have been poisoned and captured.

1305
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,875
You must beware.

1306
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:53,916
Zhiruo.

1307
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,291
You almost stabbed him to death,

1308
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:00,750
but he's still so nice to you.

1309
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,208
He bears ill will.

1310
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,250
Chief Zhang,

1311
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:09,458
we, the Emei Sect,

1312
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,125
thank you for your good intentions.

1313
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,666
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1314
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:16,333
-Master.
-Master.

1315
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:27,458
Chief, the antidote is working.

1316
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:28,583
We have recovered.

1317
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,583
The person who injured my uncle

1318
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:32,458
was using Shaolin's Vajra Finger.

1319
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:34,416
Let's first go to Shaolin

1320
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:35,833
to ask Monk Kong Wen.

1321
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,208
Yes.

1322
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:39,000
Find a safe place as soon as possible

1323
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:40,208
for me to recuperate.

1324
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:41,375
Yes.

1325
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:53,458
Looking for a place?

1326
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:54,625
We've got lots.

1327
01:30:54,958 --> 01:30:57,000
We were just going
to send you an invitation.

1328
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,666
The place reeks of blood.

1329
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:12,375
Mahavira Hall

1330
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:30,625
Who has the ability

1331
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,416
to kill everyone at Shaolin?

1332
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:37,333
"First, kill all at Shaolin,

1333
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:39,166
then destroy Wudang.

1334
01:31:39,708 --> 01:31:41,250
Only the Ming Sect

1335
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:42,750
is the king of the martial world."

1336
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,625
They are framing us for this crime.

1337
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:46,541
It must be the Imperial Court.

1338
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:50,625
Grandmaster.

1339
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:06,666
Grandmaster is in here. This way.

1340
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:07,833
Master Zhang.

1341
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:11,291
I am from Shaolin Temple.

1342
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:13,416
Young master,

1343
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:15,625
what happened to Shaolin?

1344
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:18,791
All the monks in the temple
have been assassinated.

1345
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,791
The books on the 72 Invincible Skills
have been stolen.

1346
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,000
I risked my life to escape.

1347
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:25,791
Master Zhang, I beg you to help us.

1348
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,625
Good fortune follows disaster,

1349
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,166
disaster lurks within good fortune.

1350
01:32:40,666 --> 01:32:41,625
Young monk,

1351
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:44,250
why did you try to kill me?

1352
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,291
Qingshu.

1353
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:49,666
-Qingshu.
-Grandmaster.

1354
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:51,958
I know someone wants to ambush you,

1355
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,875
so I kept running for a whole day
and night to get back here.

1356
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:57,000
Fortunately, I arrived in time to stop it.
You're blessed, Grandmaster.

1357
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:03,875
It's a sinful act.

1358
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:09,375
Grandmaster.

1359
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,166
I am useless.

1360
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:13,291
I failed to protect my fellow disciples.

1361
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:33,416
Grandmaster.

1362
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:35,916
A great man knows
how to ride the tide of his times.

1363
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,958
The Imperial Court
has knighted me Heroic General

1364
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,791
with more money than I can ever spend.

1365
01:33:41,208 --> 01:33:42,166
In Wudang,

1366
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:43,958
as long as you're still alive,

1367
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:45,750
my father will never be the sect leader.

1368
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:48,291
How much longer must I wait?

1369
01:33:48,375 --> 01:33:49,291
You are wrong.

1370
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,625
The way of heaven takes from excess
to make up for deficiencies.

1371
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,625
The way of man takes from the poor

1372
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:56,500
and gives to the rich.

1373
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:57,541
Qingshu.

1374
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:40,916
I am the Chief of Ming Sect, Zhang Wuji.

1375
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,083
Master Zhang of Wudang, greetings.

1376
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:45,791
Zhang Wuji.

1377
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:50,500
One of my disciples' sons

1378
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:51,958
is also called Zhang Wuji,

1379
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:54,791
but he died a long time ago.

1380
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,875
Master Zhang,

1381
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,666
let me be honest.

1382
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:02,958
The Imperial Court
values your virtue, reputation,

1383
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,291
and superior martial art skills.

1384
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:05,708
You are truly a martial arts guru.

1385
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:08,500
We wish to make you Imperial Master
to unite the martial world for us.

1386
01:35:08,791 --> 01:35:09,750
Four of your disciples

1387
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,500
have already arrived in Dadu as our guests

1388
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:13,250
and are waiting for you to join them.

1389
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:16,916
Swordsman Yin

1390
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,916
sparred with my Cat,

1391
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,500
who was so clumsy and careless

1392
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:23,375
that he broke all the joints
in Swordsman Yin's body.

1393
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,291
My apologies.

1394
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,750
Since all my disciples are with you,

1395
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,041
everything is resolved.

1396
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:33,916
You may go now.

1397
01:35:35,291 --> 01:35:39,291
If Wudang Sect can defeat Cat and Dog,

1398
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,958
then you don't have to come with me.

1399
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:47,708
For someone who refuses to fight,

1400
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:49,583
nobody can beat him.

1401
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:55,791
Grandmaster,

1402
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:58,083
let your grand disciple
get rid of them for you.

1403
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,375
Grandmaster.

1404
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:04,541
I am Wuji.

1405
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,208
Wuji.

1406
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:15,041
You're still alive.

1407
01:36:15,541 --> 01:36:16,375
Wuji.

1408
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:18,083
I'm alive

1409
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,416
and studying scriptures every day,

1410
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,500
including the scriptures I stole from you.

1411
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:25,208
I have digested all of them.

1412
01:36:27,583 --> 01:36:28,583
Good.

1413
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:29,875
Wonderful.

1414
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:31,625
Cuishan has an heir.

1415
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:34,166
Zhang Wuji.

1416
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:35,958
Aren't you ashamed?

1417
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,666
How dare you address
Master Zhang as Grandmaster?

1418
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,875
What a shame.

1419
01:36:40,625 --> 01:36:42,041
My late father, Zhang Cuishan,

1420
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,083
was Grandmaster's fifth disciple.

1421
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,791
How else should I address him?

1422
01:36:47,166 --> 01:36:48,208
Today, Wudang Sect

1423
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:51,458
will seek to learn the superior kung fu
of your Cat and Dog.

1424
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:13,291
Zhang Wuji,

1425
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,416
you just love provoking me.

1426
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:17,416
Don't forget.

1427
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,083
You promised to do three things for me.

1428
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,291
Of course I remember.

1429
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:23,083
Now I will ask you to do the first thing.

1430
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:25,458
You may not use any skill
you have learned before.

1431
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,666
Fine.

1432
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,083
Grandmaster, teach me a few moves.

1433
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:03,916
Great perfection seems flawed,

1434
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:05,625
yet functions smoothly.

1435
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,208
Great fullness seems empty,

1436
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:10,916
yet functions without exhaustion.

1437
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:13,916
Great straightness seems bent.

1438
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,708
Great eloquence seems stammering.

1439
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,041
Shaolin's Vajra Finger.

1440
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,500
You're the one who hurt my sixth uncle.

1441
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:00,916
His skills were poor.

1442
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:02,416
He only has himself to blame.

1443
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:49,583
-Greetings, Master Zhang.
-Greetings, Master Zhang.

1444
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,166
Perfect timing.

1445
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:54,000
Today is a great day for Wudang Sect.

1446
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:56,458
Wuji is back.

1447
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:23,875
Wuji is a rare martial arts prodigy.

1448
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:26,500
With the Great Yang Stance
as the foundation,

1449
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,458
he can learn any martial art instantly.

1450
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:01,500
Now, experience my sixth uncle's pain.

1451
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:27,458
The Heavenly Sword?

1452
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,083
Madam Miejue is on her way
to becoming our guest in Dadu.

1453
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:36,583
Aren't you the Jade-Faced Sword God,

1454
01:41:36,666 --> 01:41:37,875
Nan Gongye?

1455
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,583
I have long forgotten

1456
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:40,875
my previous name.

1457
01:41:43,458 --> 01:41:44,416
Chief Zhang,

1458
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:45,916
allow me to learn from you.

1459
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:47,541
Chief,

1460
01:41:47,958 --> 01:41:49,333
the Heavenly Sword

1461
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,708
is ten times more powerful in his hands
than in Miejue's.

1462
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:52,750
Please beware.

1463
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,083
Grandmaster,

1464
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:57,000
can you teach me some sword skills?

1465
01:41:57,083 --> 01:41:58,208
You've already learned them.

1466
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:04,625
Forget all about the tai chi moves.

1467
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:06,333
Just remember the spirit of tai chi

1468
01:42:06,416 --> 01:42:07,791
and use that with your sword.

1469
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:23,541
Understood.

1470
01:42:24,875 --> 01:42:25,875
Do you remember?

1471
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:28,125
All forgotten.

1472
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:35,708
-Xiao Zhao.
-Yes.

1473
01:42:38,708 --> 01:42:39,625
Benny.

1474
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:42,875
The Heavenly Sword isn't without an equal.

1475
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:45,458
I only have a saber...

1476
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:52,750
which I'll have to use like a sword.

1477
01:42:57,375 --> 01:42:58,500
The Dragon Saber?

1478
01:45:01,375 --> 01:45:02,416
Thank you for letting me win.

1479
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:29,458
Wuji.

1480
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:50,208
Zhang Wuji,

1481
01:45:50,291 --> 01:45:52,500
if you want to rescue the Six Major Sects,
come and find me in Dadu.

1482
01:45:56,875 --> 01:45:57,750
I'll be there.

1483
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:13,916
Please trust me.

1484
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:16,166
I'll use the Grand Diversion
to catch all of you.

1485
01:46:17,458 --> 01:46:19,125
Is Ms. Zhou prettier?

1486
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:20,541
I will be yours

1487
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,375
after all.

1488
01:46:24,083 --> 01:46:26,291
Or your little servant girl prettier

1489
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,375
or am I prettier?

1490
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:47,041
Remember you promised
to do three things for me?

1491
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:48,541
The third thing is

1492
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:52,041
I forbid you to marry Zhou Zhiruo today.

1493
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:57,541
I am the current Chief of Ming Sect,
Zhang Wuji.

1494
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
I have now replaced my mother

1495
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:07,625
as the Chief of Ming Sect's Headquarters.

1496
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:09,958
From tonight onwards,

1497
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,000
Zhou Zhiruo will lead Emei Sect.

1498
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,666
Let your daughter

1499
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:16,916
seize the Dragon Saber

1500
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,083
and present it to you.
