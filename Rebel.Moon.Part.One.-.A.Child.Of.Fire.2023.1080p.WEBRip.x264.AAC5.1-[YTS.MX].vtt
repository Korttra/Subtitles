00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.583
On the Motherworld,

00:00:45.583 --> 00:00:50.250
one thousand kings
ruled unchallenged in succession.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:54.750
But in the royal bloodline's
lust for power,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000
they consumed
everything upon their planet.

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:04.958
The Realm marched its armies
into the vastness of space,

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.458
conquering everything in its path.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.666
The glory of the Motherworld
seemed without end

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:18.416
until the treachery of an assassin's blade
struck down the King and Queen,

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:21.166
severing the royal bloodline forever.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.625
In the chaotic aftermath
of the King's death,

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:30.666
several conquered planets
on the edge of the Motherworld's reach

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.750
began to whisper of revolution.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:40.291
A senator named Balisarius
used the opportunity to seize power,

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.791
declaring himself regent.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.125
As a show of strength,
he sent his most brutal commander

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.541
into the outer reaches
of the Motherworld's dominion

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:56.958
to find and crush without mercy

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.500
those who would call themselves rebel.

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:38.541
-  Whoa.

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:51.875
Kora.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:53.375
Kora!

00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.500
I thought you were finished.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:01.916
Everyone's up in the Longhouse.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:05.500
- These are my last rows and I'll be done.
- All right.

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:07.041
Okay.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:08.333
Oh. Uh...

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.000
Den was asking where you were.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.791
He and his brother
got a big snow-elk, male.

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.833
He wanted you to see it
before he dressed it.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.625
Why was he asking for me?

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.625
Well, you know, because he's...

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.958
I, I just thought...

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:25.458
I just thought...

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:26.541
You thought?

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.500
- Move up.

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:53.500
It's been a while since we've had
fresh meat. Forgot how good it is.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.125
Den said they saw
the summer herds returning.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:58.041
Maybe three days' ride away.

00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.375
- He was asking for you.
-  I heard.

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:06.708
And, yes, it's quite impressive.

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:09.416
Which one? The animal?

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:12.250
Or...

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:20.500
Or the hunter?

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:24.208
Hey!

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:33.625
My people,

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.875
it is my duty
as the head of this community

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:40.958
to remind you that
the gods of the harvest demand a tribute.

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:42.791
Yeah.

00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:44.166
An offering.

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:48.041
But we all know
it is the thrusting of hips...

00:05:49.208 --> 00:05:55.625
...and the loud sounds of pleasure
that summon the seedlings to sprout.

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.291
-  Yeah!

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:59.416
So make love tonight.

00:05:59.416 --> 00:06:03.250
For the harvest. For the very food we eat.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.166
- Yeah!
-  Yeah!

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.333
For the gods!

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:13.833
Let's have some music.

00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:16.083
Some music to get us in the mood.

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:48.125
Den is a good man.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:51.583
You should be asleep.

00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:55.208
He's the best hunter among us.

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:57.375
And a loyal friend.

00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:04.208
Have you thought of
a more permanent relationship?

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.250
I know that he's amenable to the idea.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:10.250
He's asked me himself.

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.458
It's easy between us.

00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:16.500
Does it have to be more than that?

00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:21.583
It's just, uh...

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:27.541
That would be your last step to becoming
a full member of this community.

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.750
I'm telling you, this is home now.

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:36.625
I want that to be true.

00:07:42.416 --> 00:07:43.416
You know,

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:48.458
the two seasons I've spent here
have given me happiness

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.125
that I don't deserve.

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.291
But understand, I am a child of war.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:02.541
To truly love and be loved, I...

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:06.541
I don't know if I'm capable of either.

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:15.666
The very idea of love,
of... family was beaten out of me.

00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:20.958
I was taught that love is weakness.

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:25.333
And I...

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:29.791
I don't know how that will ever change.

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:39.833
You should get some rest.

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:43.541
Yeah.

00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:57.583
I noticed
you left early last night.

00:08:58.208 --> 00:08:59.625
Were you tired?

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:02.500
That's right.
I thought I'd make it an early night.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.083
I thought you were
doing your part for the harvest.

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:07.833
Because as I walked home,
I passed Den's house.

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.875
- That's what it sounded like.

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:12.208
Sam, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:15.041
I think you do.

00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:14.750
What do you think they want?

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:18.166
Everything.

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:23.125
I don't care
what the potential upside might be,

00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:25.833
a warship hanging over our land
cannot be good.

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:29.125
That's your problem.
Your first reaction is always fear.

00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:31.083
The Motherworld has deep pockets.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:33.791
I'm simply saying
maybe we can get a better price

00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:35.541
from our friends in low orbit there,

00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:38.541
rather than having to deal with
the cutthroats in Providence,

00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.916
selling our grain to God only knows.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:45.083
Don't act like we don't know
you've been selling our surplus grain

00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:46.916
to the enemies of that ship up there.

00:10:48.166 --> 00:10:52.083
I wonder what they would say if they
found out where our excess went last year.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.500
Well, I'm no revolutionary.

00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:57.791
They offered the best price.
I don't care about their cause.

00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:58.833
Obviously.

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:03.708
Sindri, I don't have a side,
only this community.

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.541
That's my only loyalty.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:10.333
And I say we start
by showing them goodwill, not fear.

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:14.625
That we are their partners,
not their adversaries, right?

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.333
Did you say "partner," Gunnar?

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:19.916
I did. Is that a problem?

00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:22.208
That ship does not represent prosperity.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.125
Its purpose is to destroy,
to subjugate, to enslave.

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:30.125
- Partnership is not in its vocabulary.

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:31.625
Give them what they ask for.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:34.458
But volunteer nothing
about how fertile this land is.

00:11:35.625 --> 00:11:37.333
And hope they leave
before digging too deep

00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:39.333
into who Gunnar sold last year's grain to.

00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:42.750
- Right.
- I've heard enough. We volunteer nothing.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.125
Is that clear?

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:45.291
They're here!

00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:48.875
They're coming! They're coming!
They're coming!

00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:19.958
Hello. I am Sindri,
father of this village.

00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:20.916
Welcome.

00:13:21.666 --> 00:13:23.416
I'm Admiral Atticus Noble.

00:13:23.416 --> 00:13:25.791
Loyal representative of the slain King.

00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:27.583
I welcome you to his warm embrace.

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:49.333
Please, father,
tell me about this beautiful village.

00:13:50.416 --> 00:13:52.291
Walk with me up to our Longhouse.

00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:55.583
We can have a cup of ale
and I will tell you about life here.

00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:59.166
Oh. Sounds perfect. Lead the way.

00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:17.125
We've carved out
a simple life here.

00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:20.666
And we take pride
in the love of our community,

00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:22.875
and the hard work
it takes to survive here.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.958
Your people
seem healthy and well-fed.

00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958
As their leader, much of that prosperity
must be credited to you.

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958
No, we are a community.
The credit is no one person's.

00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.375
Oh, I know that in the best of times,
the credit's shared,

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:38.000
but when the stores are empty,
you know where the responsibility falls.

00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:41.083
The weight of the leader, I suppose.

00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:47.583
So you... you understand
the feeling of, like, a father,

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:50.041
the need to feed your children, yes?

00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:54.583
I was hoping that your land
and the people of Veldt might help

00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:58.333
as we search for a small band
of revolutionaries hiding in this system.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:03.166
Who my commander, the Regent Balisarius,
bid me find and bring to justice.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.750
We are humble farmers,

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.291
far removed from the politics
of the Motherworld.

00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:11.958
- And still you can serve. Hmm.

00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.458
The rebels we seek
have been attacking our supply ports.

00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:19.250
Led by a woman named Devra Bloodaxe,
and her brother Darrian.

00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:21.958
Their capture's inevitable.

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.083
However,
it's taken longer than anticipated,

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:27.958
and we found ourselves
admittedly low on stores.

00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:32.625
And as you know or may have heard,
an army runs on its stomach.

00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:37.500
I was thinking of a partnership,
where you supply us with food.

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:40.083
Whatever you have to spare, of course.

00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:42.541
In exchange, you're compensated at...

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:45.583
Let's call it triple
the market value, shall we?

00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:50.416
With that windfall, you'll be able
to buy plenty of harvesters, robots,

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:52.708
and won't have to do
this difficult work by hand.

00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:59.416
We believe that doing the work by hand
connects us to the land

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:02.333
and honors these sacred fields
that give us life.

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:05.416
There's peace of mind knowing
that you're invaluable

00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:08.916
in the important mission of
rooting out enemies of the Motherworld.

00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:24.041
-  It's quite a proposal.
-  Yes.

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:26.041
If only we had
some surplus to offer.

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:28.000
You see, the land is rocky

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.916
and yields barely enough
to feed ourselves.

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:34.875
So, it is with sincere apologies
that we must decline the offer.

00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:36.791
However, we are grateful

00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:40.541
for the presence of such
a benevolent and powerful protector.

00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:44.916
Huh.

00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:46.000
No surplus?

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.583
- None at all?

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:51.791
Huh.

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:53.416
But your land looks so fertile.

00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:56.791
Your fields seem larger
than what your population might need.

00:16:56.791 --> 00:16:58.875
Of course, I understand how it might seem.

00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:03.250
Yet the scale of the planting
is evidence of the poor soil.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.291
And our harsh winters
only add to the short season.

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.833
Now, what do you say
we share that cup of ale, eh?

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.291
Sorry.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.333
It's just...

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:27.791
I mean, look at these beautiful people.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.083
I can't imagine these glowing complexions
are nourished by a barren field.

00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:40.833
Now... who's the man or woman among you
who oversees the harvest?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.416
There must be one
whose thumb is greener than the rest.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:50.333
Someone?

00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:52.583
Hmm?

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:54.458
Yes, sir.

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:55.958
-  Ah.
- That is me.

00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:57.666
Good.

00:17:57.666 --> 00:17:59.708
Yes, I oversee the harvest.

00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:03.458
Well, if these people trust you,
then so do I.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.000
Trying to understand how I could be
so wrong about what this land could yield.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.291
That's all.

00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:13.541
Well, sir.

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:22.000
Sindri, our beloved father, is always
looking out for the welfare of our village

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.125
and so insists on keeping reserves
in case of famine or drought,

00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:28.916
which, as you know,
is the responsibility of a leader.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.125
But we have been lucky
these last few seasons.

00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:38.250
Our surplus has been
more than we can store.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.791
So, there might be

00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.416
a chance that we can spare a small amount.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.083
Depending, of course,
on the scale of your needs.

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:48.625
Mmm. Good. Good.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.000
Yeah, I mean, it's always wise
to hold some in reserve, isn't it, father?

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.375
Yep. Yep.

00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:02.708
I am confused though.

00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:05.208
Curious why you should have me believe

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:07.583
this land could barely yield enough
to feed your people.

00:19:07.583 --> 00:19:10.208
- Seems that wasn't entirely true.
-  No, wait, wait.

00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:13.708
Admiral, no one is trying to mislead you.

00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:18.791
Sindri simply has a slightly more
conservative view on reserves than I do.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.458
But we're both excited
about a possible partnership.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.833
Just bear in mind
the reality of what we can supply.

00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:34.666
Father, who is this exactly?

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.916
- Uh... My...
-  He's of no consequence.

00:19:38.583 --> 00:19:41.208
I have been empowered
by my people to speak for them.

00:19:41.875 --> 00:19:44.208
This man has no authority here.

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:47.666
You would be wise to ignore him.

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:50.375
Well... a rift.

00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:53.916
It's not quite
the idyllic community I'd first seen.

00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:56.625
Father, if I may

00:19:58.041 --> 00:20:02.750
offer you some advice when dealing with
subordinates who need to be kept in place.

00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:07.625
I find people can lose sight of the stakes
and sometimes need a gentle reminder

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.083
of just how those with power
deal with those without.

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:41.458
Admiral.

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:43.375
Sindri...

00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:44.916
Please.

00:20:44.916 --> 00:20:47.041
- No, I... I would never...
- It's fine.

00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:55.250
-  I...
- Let me show you what I mean.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Uh...

00:20:57.916 --> 00:20:58.916
Please.

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:02.083
Admiral.

00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:12.625
No, stop!

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:15.250
No!

00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:28.000
What did you do?

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.791
When can I expect my harvest?

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.291
Oh...

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:34.375
I don't...

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.125
I said, tell me, partner,
when I can expect my harvest.

00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:41.833
Uh... Um...

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:44.208
- Nine... nine weeks.
- Very well.

00:21:46.083 --> 00:21:47.708
In ten weeks, I shall return.

00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:51.333
You shall have
my 10,000 bushels prepared for my ship.

00:21:51.916 --> 00:21:55.375
Twelve... We barely produce 12,000 bushels.

00:21:55.375 --> 00:21:56.750
We'll starve to death.

00:21:57.541 --> 00:21:59.375
I don't understand what you want.

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:01.125
Well, it's simple.

00:22:03.375 --> 00:22:04.625
I want everything.

00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:23.666
All right, listen up.

00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:26.583
I need all of this gear moved
to this big stone building.

00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:28.208
That should suit us for now.

00:22:28.208 --> 00:22:32.000
Marcus, you're gonna help me evict
the current residents from our new home.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.958
Copy?

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.625
Copy you, boss.

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:37.125
Copy you.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.125
Hello, everyone.

00:22:55.625 --> 00:22:59.250
I am JC-1435
of the Mechanicas Militarium,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:00.583
defender of the King.

00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:03.791
Correction, of the slain King.

00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:05.708
It is my honor to serve.

00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:07.833
I'm Private Aris.

00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:12.375
We're moving supplies to that building,
if you wouldn't mind lending a hand.

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.375
Thank you, Private Aris.

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:17.333
That falls perfectly into my protocols.

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:20.958
I'm talking to you,
you dirty drain turtle. Come here.

00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:23.000
The hell you waiting for?
Get out, man!

00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:39.708
Mmm.

00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:49.125
Thank you.

00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:04.291
Now, what in the name of the old gods
are you looking at?

00:24:04.291 --> 00:24:08.166
I'm sorry, I was just waiting to see
if you needed some more water.

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:09.333
Some more water?

00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:17.708
That's how I like 'em.
Young, strong enough to put up a fight.

00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:22.875
- Boss.
-  Hmm?

00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:24.375
Look, they left us a Jimmy.

00:24:26.375 --> 00:24:27.625
It's a Jimmy, man.

00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:32.541
I didn't know we had any of those left.

00:24:38.833 --> 00:24:41.958
All right, careful. The ground's uneven
till you get to the bridge.

00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:45.833
Thank you, Private Aris,
but I believe I can manage.

00:24:45.833 --> 00:24:47.541
They won't fight anymore.

00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:49.750
What do you mean they won't fight anymore?

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.666
It's something in their programming.

00:24:51.666 --> 00:24:53.333
Once the King was killed,

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:56.958
they just laid down their weapons
and refused to fight.

00:24:56.958 --> 00:25:00.875
Just watch, no matter what I do,
he doesn't fight back.

00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:07.000
Hey!

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.208
Careful with that stuff,
you stupid machine.

00:25:09.208 --> 00:25:11.791
I'll turn you into scrap, you dumbshit.
You hear me?

00:25:12.625 --> 00:25:14.208
You're not hearing me.

00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:20.458
Hey! Stop.

00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:24.541
What if I shoot you instead, huh?

00:25:25.583 --> 00:25:28.416
I could kill you right now
and no one would care.

00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:30.875
- Would they?
-  That's enough.

00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.333
What do you say? Wanna die?

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:34.500
What's it, huh?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.416
Come on, boy.

00:25:38.333 --> 00:25:39.458
I said, enough.

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:49.833
Get these crates
into that house now, Private.

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:51.416
Yes, boss.

00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:01.000
Are you malfunctioning?

00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:03.250
No, sir.

00:26:05.416 --> 00:26:08.250
Get up. Go to the river. Clean yourself.

00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:13.041
The rest of you, stop staring.

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:14.291
Get back to work.

00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:15.958
Get back to work, assholes.

00:26:15.958 --> 00:26:18.041
That includes you, Marcus.

00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:19.500
You got it?

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.500
Excuse me.

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:52.291
Thank you. That is kind.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.708
- You're a soldier?
- Long ago.

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:00.791
Do you mind? I'm Sam.

00:27:00.791 --> 00:27:01.875
Please.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.708
Tell me, Sam.
Do you know the story of our slain King

00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:17.666
and his beautiful daughter,
the Princess Issa?

00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:18.791
I don't.

00:27:18.791 --> 00:27:22.208
Well, you remind me of her.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.125
In myth, she was called
the Chalice or the Redeemer.

00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:30.041
She was pueri salvatoris.

00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:32.291
And even before she was born,

00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:35.333
I and my brothers
pledged everything we were,

00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:38.500
everything that dwells
inside this metal skin,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.166
to fight in her name.

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:45.666
So when word reached us
on some distant battlefield

00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:50.291
that she, as prophesied, had been born
of flesh and blood into our world,

00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:54.166
I felt a great warmth for the universe

00:27:54.958 --> 00:28:00.041
and trusted that she was to usher in
a new age of peace and compassion.

00:28:01.833 --> 00:28:03.375
And bring us home.

00:28:05.833 --> 00:28:07.208
She was magic.

00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:10.791
Ah, yes.
She was more than magic.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.208
On the day of her coronation,

00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:18.625
she, along with
our honored King and Queen,

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:23.791
were assassinated in cold blood
by those they trusted most.

00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:29.416
I fear we lost some measure
of our honor since that betrayal.

00:28:31.083 --> 00:28:34.583
I'm afraid our compassion, our kindness,

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.458
our very joy,

00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:40.916
died with that young girl.

00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:51.791
I think it lives in you.

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:34.958
This is your fault, Gunnar!

00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:37.041
I didn't know that he would kill them.

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.750
Doesn't matter. He's dead now.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.125
What about the soldiers?
Next, it's gonna be the other house.

00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:44.416
-  I don't know.
- Stop, please.

00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:47.791
How about we bring in the crop
and we fall on their mercy?

00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:48.791
Yeah.

00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:51.458
We make ourselves invaluable.
They wouldn't be able to kill us.

00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:53.833
- They would need us.
- He's right.

00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:58.791
Farming, that is our skill
that we can do, that they cannot.

00:29:58.791 --> 00:30:02.125
If we show them how good we are,
they will be forced to spare us.

00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.541
- Yes.
- Yes. Yeah.

00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.916
- Do we agree? Our work fights for us.
-  Yes!

00:30:06.916 --> 00:30:08.916
- Our work fights for us. Yes?
-  Yes!

00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:11.791
It's settled then.

00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:14.125
- We show them how valuable we are.
-  Okay.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:16.333
And when we have fulfilled
our side of the deal,

00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:19.333
they will be forced to rethink
how much food they leave us.

00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:20.416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:24.333
We can appeal to those gentlemen
in the granary, appeal to their humanity.

00:30:24.333 --> 00:30:25.750
-  Yeah.
- Good.

00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:36.833
So... it's running.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.833
Would've thought
you'd have had enough of that.

00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:45.708
You heard them. They're delusional.

00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:49.416
They think those soldiers will show mercy
even after what they did to Sindri,

00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:51.291
right in front of them.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.166
When I found you
in the wreckage of that ship,

00:31:00.083 --> 00:31:01.666
I considered leaving you.

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:04.750
I was afraid
you could bring trouble to us.

00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:10.333
But do I for a moment
regret bringing you into our lives?

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:11.833
I do not.

00:31:12.916 --> 00:31:14.291
You've become a part of us.

00:31:15.166 --> 00:31:18.625
And yet, now you leave
when we need you most.

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.416
When your people need you.

00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:27.375
I can't.

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:29.458
You mean, you won't?

00:31:30.958 --> 00:31:32.375
This place is already lost.

00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:34.208
But what if that could change?

00:31:34.208 --> 00:31:37.375
What if we did fight,
not only us, but others?

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:39.625
- Who else would come here and fight?
- Others! Others!

00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:43.708
Others that have reason to hate
all that the Motherworld represents.

00:31:46.333 --> 00:31:49.083
Kora, you know this universe
better than I.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.916
What if you could find
the warriors that Noble seeks?

00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:58.500
The outlaws to fight alongside us?

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:02.375
If I find warriors to fight for Veldt,
I give the village hope.

00:32:03.375 --> 00:32:05.583
If I give them hope,
they fight and surely lose.

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:08.666
I won't have that blood on my hands.

00:32:09.458 --> 00:32:12.333
Nor will I throw my life away
the same as the rest of you.

00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:39.791
Check this.

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:41.583
Hey, water girl!

00:32:43.541 --> 00:32:45.166
-  Come here.
-  What is it?

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:47.125
Did you need some more water?

00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:49.916
Just a... a little water.

00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:51.333
Stop it!

00:32:53.041 --> 00:32:54.208
Or what?

00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:58.458
-  Help! Help!

00:32:58.458 --> 00:33:00.250
Please, help!

00:33:03.791 --> 00:33:05.166
Help!

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:06.583
- Shut up!
- Get off me!

00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:08.291
- Help me!
-  Shut up!

00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:12.958
No. Please!

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:17.708
-  Shut up.
- Someone help me, please! Please, help!

00:33:17.708 --> 00:33:19.916
- Help me! Get off of me!
-  Shut up!

00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:21.541
Get off me!

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.041
Don't!

00:33:24.875 --> 00:33:27.833
Attaboy. What do you have in mind?

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:52.083
I'm gonna tie you to a post
and make you watch every day

00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:54.708
as she turns from a farm girl to a whore.

00:33:58.875 --> 00:34:00.541
Marcus, my good man...

00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:07.541
This all sounds nice,

00:34:08.208 --> 00:34:10.125
but you're not gonna do anything.

00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:15.291
Not until I split this sapling myself.

00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:23.708
Then you may have her.

00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:26.666
Then you can all have her.

00:34:30.541 --> 00:34:32.791
- Get off her!

00:34:35.458 --> 00:34:36.458
Stop!

00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:47.208
Stop.

00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:52.208
Dessert.
Perfect.

00:34:52.958 --> 00:34:54.375
Definitely get her.

00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:44.416
Please.

00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:45.708
I will kill her.

00:36:46.416 --> 00:36:48.000
Is that what you want? Huh?

00:36:48.583 --> 00:36:49.416
Huh?

00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.791
Ah, look who decided to join us.

00:36:53.833 --> 00:36:56.000
Kill her. Kill them both.

00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:15.583
What are you waiting for?
I gave you an order.

00:37:15.583 --> 00:37:16.500
Kill this b...

00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:08.375
We're gonna have to fight.

00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:14.916
Kora, you may need this.

00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:21.166
I found it at the site of the crash.

00:38:29.041 --> 00:38:30.458
I thought it was lost.

00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:36.125
Our culture is not for such weapons.

00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:42.041
I feared it could be dangerous.

00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:45.458
You were right.

00:38:46.375 --> 00:38:47.208
Thank you.

00:38:50.291 --> 00:38:51.666
Where will you go?

00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:55.250
There is someone, a general named Titus.

00:38:55.958 --> 00:38:57.708
Once a hero of the Realm

00:38:57.708 --> 00:39:00.750
who turned his own forces
against those of the Motherworld.

00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:04.416
Last I heard,
he was still out there somewhere.

00:39:05.166 --> 00:39:07.500
If I could find him
and men for him to lead...

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.083
Gunnar.

00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:15.458
Last year, in Providence,
you sold grain to the resistance.

00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:23.125
Yes. I met a man there
who introduced me to the insurgents.

00:39:23.708 --> 00:39:24.708
The Bloodaxes.

00:39:25.708 --> 00:39:28.416
- Would he still know how to find them?
- It's possible.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.666
Then you'll take me to him?

00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:33.041
Of course I will.

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:40.125
Hey! Bring down one more uraki!

00:39:44.375 --> 00:39:46.166
A general and an army?

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.208
We might stand a chance.

00:39:54.833 --> 00:39:55.833
Be careful.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.583
A safe journey... to the both of you.

00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:52.750
So you were a soldier
for the Motherworld?

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.625
Fighting for the Realm?

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:00.416
You could say that.

00:41:04.125 --> 00:41:05.541
Of high rank, I suppose?

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:16.083
I mean, are you wanted for desertion?

00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:18.250
That and more.

00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:21.041
Okay.

00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:24.375
Anything else you wanna ask me?

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.500
They won't just kill us,
will they?

00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:31.708
I mean, I understand
making an example of Sindri

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.416
to keep us in line.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.708
But we're just farmers,
we're not a threat.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.500
How can you know they will destroy us?

00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:46.208
When they first came to my world,
I was nine years old.

00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:49.583
They never asked for anything.

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.916
There were no terms.

00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:57.416
Only the lust for destruction.

00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:05.791
The Motherworld's forces were commanded
by a young general named Balisarius,

00:42:05.791 --> 00:42:08.250
who relished the ecstasy of combat.

00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:16.041
The people of my world
had mounted a brave defense,

00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:20.458
but it had served
only to enrage the young general

00:42:20.458 --> 00:42:24.083
and gave him provocation
to take out that anger on the innocent.

00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:41.875
I found myself
face-to-face with Balisarius,

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:45.333
who loved commanding his troops,

00:42:45.333 --> 00:42:47.708
not from the conning tower of his ships,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.958
but on the battlefield itself.

00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:38.375
Balisarius killed my entire family
and took me with him.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.125
I don't know why he spared me.

00:43:43.083 --> 00:43:46.125
Why, of the hundreds of thousands
that died at his hands,

00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:47.708
he chose me to live.

00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:51.625
Saw something in me, I suppose.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.541
Someone to share in his pain.

00:44:01.125 --> 00:44:03.250
They gave me the name Arthelais,

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.500
began my training and education
in the histories of the Motherworld.

00:44:08.541 --> 00:44:11.750
And for five years,
I lived on that ship with its soldiers,

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.375
who were my only family.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.083
No softness.

00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:19.083
Only the hard lessons of war.

00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:31.750
He took me often on missions of diplomacy,

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:34.125
and I was his child.

00:44:35.083 --> 00:44:38.250
I was his protégé. I was his student.

00:44:40.166 --> 00:44:41.708
I was one of them.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.500
Daughter of a decorated commander.

00:44:46.416 --> 00:44:48.791
Friend to the King and the royal family.

00:44:49.458 --> 00:44:51.541
- Living a life of privilege.
-

00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:13.083
But regardless
of my social standing,

00:45:13.083 --> 00:45:14.875
I was expected to do my duty.

00:45:15.666 --> 00:45:17.291
To fight for the Motherworld.

00:45:29.833 --> 00:45:33.666
At the Academy Militarium,
they encouraged us to find a lover.

00:45:36.416 --> 00:45:39.000
Someone we would defend with our lives

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.666
when the politics of expansion
became too abstract,

00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:47.333
and the why of the conquest
was lost in sheer savagery of combat.

00:45:51.958 --> 00:45:55.000
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.666
So, at the age of 18,
I was made an officer and given a command.

00:46:58.541 --> 00:47:00.958
I fought for the King
on distant worlds

00:47:00.958 --> 00:47:04.750
under the banner of a people
who murdered my entire family

00:47:05.708 --> 00:47:07.541
and destroyed my world.

00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:09.625
They had trained me,

00:47:10.375 --> 00:47:13.291
broken me, and rebuilt me in their image.

00:47:17.083 --> 00:47:19.583
I'm only telling you this
so you know who I am.

00:47:22.708 --> 00:47:25.041
You asked how I know
that they'll destroy you.

00:47:27.125 --> 00:47:28.750
That's what I would do.

00:48:07.458 --> 00:48:08.375
Hawkshaws.

00:48:09.875 --> 00:48:12.666
Bounty hunters.
They work for the Imperium.

00:48:17.958 --> 00:48:18.791
Wait.

00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:20.916
-  Oh, no.

00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:23.708
That's our guy.
That's the man we came to see.

00:48:23.708 --> 00:48:25.916
The one that introduced me
to the Bloodaxes.

00:48:27.458 --> 00:48:29.708
Did the Bloodaxes give you
any other way to contact them?

00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:34.000
No. They said they were
sheltered on a planet called Sharaan.

00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:37.375
- Protected by a king named Levitica.
- Levitica.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.250
Come.

00:49:35.583 --> 00:49:36.625
Carbost.

00:49:38.708 --> 00:49:41.541
Anyway, I think our best chance
to find the Bloodaxes

00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:43.583
is to contact the Leviticans.

00:49:43.583 --> 00:49:44.958
It might expose us.

00:49:44.958 --> 00:49:47.625
First we find General Titus,
then we'll see about your rebels.

00:49:56.916 --> 00:49:58.208
Is this your owner?

00:49:58.208 --> 00:49:59.916
Move on. He's not for sale.

00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:03.833
Everything's for sale in this place,
so... [inhales sharply] how much?

00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:06.291
You know, I have a room upstairs...

00:50:06.291 --> 00:50:08.833
...with relatively clean sheets.

00:50:08.833 --> 00:50:11.208
That's a very generous offer.
But I don't think so...

00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:14.458
I guarantee you, by morning,

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.666
you're gonna be begging me for more.

00:50:18.458 --> 00:50:20.375
- I said, move on.

00:50:21.125 --> 00:50:22.708
- Come on, Mama.

00:50:22.708 --> 00:50:25.750
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let him come and play.

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:26.833
You need to leave.

00:50:26.833 --> 00:50:29.583
Listen close, you jealous little bitch.

00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:38.666
Now you listen close.
I told you, you need to leave.

00:50:59.041 --> 00:51:00.875
I'm looking for information.

00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:11.083
Has anyone here heard of General Titus
or know where he might be?

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:21.375
Of course, General Titus.

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:28.750
Crazy bastard. Turned his own men
on the Motherworld's forces

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.875
at the Battle of Sarawu.

00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:34.166
Do you know of his location?

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:38.375
Last I heard,
he was fighting in the coliseum at Pollux.

00:51:43.041 --> 00:51:45.375
I'd be careful if I were you, little miss.

00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:49.250
Last hunter who went looking for him
ended up with his head on a pike

00:51:50.625 --> 00:51:52.583
outside the coliseum entrance

00:51:53.333 --> 00:51:56.416
as a warning not to bother him.

00:52:03.833 --> 00:52:05.208
So, he's on Pollux.

00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:08.916
- That's your plan?
- That's my plan.

00:52:11.625 --> 00:52:12.458
What?

00:52:12.458 --> 00:52:14.625
Guess we need to
find a ship to take us to Pollux.

00:52:15.958 --> 00:52:17.250
You're catching on.

00:52:19.833 --> 00:52:21.958
Hey! Bitch!

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:25.750
Oh.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.958
You should have killed me.

00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:29.458
Now you're gonna die.

00:52:31.375 --> 00:52:36.625
I'm gonna give you one chance
to just turn and walk away.

00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:38.000
Uh-oh.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.541
Are you gonna give all of us one chance?

00:52:59.791 --> 00:53:01.250
- Kill her.

00:54:33.583 --> 00:54:34.583
Impressive.

00:54:38.833 --> 00:54:41.750
Were those Hawkshaws that paid you
working for the Motherworld?

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:44.291
- I don't like bounty hunters.
-  I didn't ask.

00:54:44.291 --> 00:54:47.083
And to be clear,
I don't like bounty hunters either.

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.458
So you're a gun for hire?

00:54:48.458 --> 00:54:50.583
No. That's not my thing.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:54.541
I'm more of an opportunist, you might say.

00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:55.875
A real hero, huh?

00:54:58.416 --> 00:54:59.500
Wait.

00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:04.541
Look. I heard you in there,

00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:06.041
trying to get to Pollux.

00:55:07.125 --> 00:55:08.041
I could help you.

00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:11.000
Oh, understand, we're just simple farmers.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.166
We're searching for soldiers
for a fight against the Motherworld.

00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:18.375
We have some money,
but this is not the one you get rich on.

00:55:18.375 --> 00:55:20.041
Aye, I understand.

00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:23.125
Still, pay me what it's worth to you.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Soldiers for a fight
against the Motherworld?

00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:30.875
Well, my name's Kai.

00:55:30.875 --> 00:55:33.333
Come on, my ship's down at port.

00:56:08.125 --> 00:56:10.125
Right. Setting course for Pollux.

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.250
I need to stop on Neu-Wodi first.

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:15.583
You know, there's a rancher there.

00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:17.583
He has a man
that might just work out for you.

00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:19.166
Is he worth our time?

00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:21.250
Because we can't afford to waste any.

00:56:22.083 --> 00:56:23.291
I think you'll like him.

00:56:24.333 --> 00:56:25.708
You ever been off-planet?

00:56:25.708 --> 00:56:26.916
No.

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.666
What did you do on the farm?

00:56:28.666 --> 00:56:33.041
I oversee the harvest, and planting,
cataloguing seeds, and making sure that...

00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:35.125
That sounds great.
You might want to hold on.

00:56:46.791 --> 00:56:49.208
Whoo!

00:56:49.916 --> 00:56:51.000
Whoa.

00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:27.416
Come in.

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.083
Oh, Cassius, it's you. Good.

00:57:35.833 --> 00:57:38.291
We received a communiqué
from the Hawkshaws.

00:57:38.958 --> 00:57:41.208
They're requesting to rendezvous with us.

00:57:42.583 --> 00:57:44.500
Apparently they've captured a creature

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.666
that has important information
about the insurgents,

00:57:47.666 --> 00:57:50.000
Devra Bloodaxe and her brother.

00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:53.000
Bloodaxe? Huh.

00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:55.458
- Well, that...

00:57:55.458 --> 00:57:56.875
That's excellent, Cassius.

00:57:57.916 --> 00:57:59.583
Inform me when they arrive.

00:57:59.583 --> 00:58:01.083
-  Yes, sir.
- Hey.

00:58:20.625 --> 00:58:25.166
Well, if it isn't
the bastard from Saaldorun.

00:58:27.458 --> 00:58:30.875
- What brings you all the way out here?
- I missed your smiling face.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.500
You still got
that man chained in the back?

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.875
Tarak? Yeah,
he's working off his debt to me.

00:58:36.875 --> 00:58:40.500
Another couple dozen seasons,
we should be square.

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.666
What's it to you?

00:58:42.166 --> 00:58:43.541
You mind if we talk to him?

00:58:44.708 --> 00:58:46.500
Could be a deal in it for ya.

00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:50.666
Well, if there's money to be made...

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.708
Hey!

00:58:55.958 --> 00:58:57.625
Hey! Tarak!

00:59:00.125 --> 00:59:02.083
These people want to talk to you.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:07.250
- What got that chain on your leg?
-  A long road of mistakes.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:10.958
But if you're here to accuse me
of crimes against the Motherworld,

00:59:11.458 --> 00:59:13.291
I'm guilty as charged.
Take it up with him.

00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:15.333
No. That's not why we're here.

00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:21.375
We're here from a small village,
and we're looking to hire some fighters

00:59:21.375 --> 00:59:24.791
to train and protect us
against a force from the Motherworld.

00:59:25.958 --> 00:59:28.041
- I'm no friend of the Realm.
- Okay.

00:59:28.041 --> 00:59:29.625
That's well-known.

00:59:29.625 --> 00:59:31.625
And I'd gladly fight with you,

00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:34.375
but... I have a debt on my name,

00:59:34.375 --> 00:59:35.791
and I honor my debts.

00:59:37.125 --> 00:59:38.416
What's he owe you?

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:40.666
Uh...

00:59:40.666 --> 00:59:44.708
300,000 Darams ought to cover
any inconvenience I've suffered.

00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:46.208
Oh, ya bollocks.

00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:47.958
We don't have that kind of money.

00:59:47.958 --> 00:59:49.000
No money.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.750
Well, I do love to gamble.

00:59:55.333 --> 00:59:56.541
Here we go.

00:59:56.541 --> 00:59:57.541
What's the bet?

00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:02.500
If Tarak can break that creature
out there, his debts are squared with me.

01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:05.541
But if he don't ride him,

01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:09.208
you all get a chain and a shackle.

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:10.583
That's the deal.

01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:11.875
Grab it tighter!

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.250
Watch its tail!

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.416
Can you ride him?

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:31.291
Yeah... I can ride him.

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:36.291
Yank it hard!
Don't let him fight you like that!

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.083
Pull!

01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:54.750
Drop your leads.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.458
She'll tear you apart.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:59.416
Drop your leads and clear out now.

01:00:59.416 --> 01:01:01.750
Suit yourself. Drop them.

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:18.708
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:25.583
You're far from home and so am I.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.875
See, you and I...

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:31.333
...we are alike.

01:01:33.333 --> 01:01:35.833
We've been hurt. Betrayed.

01:01:35.833 --> 01:01:37.458
Our trust has been broken.

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:46.666
We both know fear.

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:49.166
Yet, the biggest fear we both face...

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:00.875
...is the fear of ourselves.

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:06.875
That's it.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:12.666
Let's show them we're not afraid.

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:18.250
Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.625
Easy. Easy. Easy.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:56.041
Whoo!

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.125
There.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.166
Yeah.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.416
It's okay.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:01.541
Hickman, I've done as you asked.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:03.500
Your debt is square with me.

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:09.708
Be good to her.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:41.750
Go! Get out!

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:43.500
-  Hey!

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:51.291
No.

01:06:51.291 --> 01:06:52.250
Hey.

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:54.291
No. No.

01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:01.375
Attagirl.

01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:03.625
Tarak! Let's go.

01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:07.583
This was good.
Anyone else you know of along the way?

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.083
I might have a couple ideas.

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.708
So, what's the job?

01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:25.166
We represent a village
on a small moon called Veldt.

01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:28.875
This village
faces the threat of annihilation

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.708
by the armies of the Motherworld.

01:08:32.416 --> 01:08:34.458
We are looking for warriors

01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:37.250
to join the fight to protect them.

01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:40.458
With your reputation,

01:08:40.458 --> 01:08:43.166
we thought it might be something
you'd be interested in.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:45.375
- Nemesis, please, please.
- Hold her.

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:47.458
Help her. Please, please.

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:42.416
Stay back.

01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:45.583
I just want to talk. That's all.

01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:49.583
I'm clearly distressed, that's true.

01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:54.000
But I'm not stupid.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.875
I know why you're here.
You want the child.

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:00.291
Yes, I do.

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.791
You can't have this one.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.166
This one is mine.

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.625
She has a mother who's waiting for her.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:08.958
Who's missing her.

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:11.541
And why should I care
about that mother's pain

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.333
when no one is here for my pain?

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:17.916
- This was my home before they came.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.083
Taste the air.

01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:22.875
It's poisoned my body.

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:27.666
It weakens my eggs,
and now, my children cannot emerge.

01:10:29.083 --> 01:10:30.541
I deserve justice.

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:32.291
I understand.

01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:34.666
But this is not the way.

01:10:35.791 --> 01:10:39.041
There is a difference
between justice and revenge.

01:10:40.375 --> 01:10:41.375
Is there?

01:10:42.416 --> 01:10:43.833
I'm not so sure.

01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:45.958
I know a mother's pain.

01:10:47.583 --> 01:10:49.666
I know the loneliness of that pain.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.000
But you can't hurt that child.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.125
I won't let you.

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.875
I believe you. But understand.

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:02.333
- I will kill this child.

01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:06.583
And I will keep killing
until every mother weeps tears of regret

01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:09.208
for ever having come
to the mines of Daggus.

01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:06.125
Shit!

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:12.958
Come on.

01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:21.625
Let's go.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.666
Come. Back up! Back up!

01:12:50.416 --> 01:12:51.708
- Come here.

01:14:02.666 --> 01:14:05.291
Wow. That was...

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:07.583
That was amazing.

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:10.458
Do not celebrate this.

01:14:11.791 --> 01:14:13.708
There's no honor in this.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.583
This could easily be any of you lying here

01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:20.791
in the gutter of some forgotten world,

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.291
in the name of revenge.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:29.166
You would do well to remember that.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.791
That was good of you earlier.
With the child.

01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:05.083
- I was just trying to help.
- Yes, but it's not natural for some.

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.458
It is for you.

01:15:06.458 --> 01:15:10.250
Back home,
you saved Sam without hesitation.

01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:15.833
Kindness is a virtue worth dying for.

01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:18.250
I believe that.

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:21.458
I didn't always.

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:27.000
I told you how I fought
on countless worlds.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:31.875
Well, word of my victories
reached my adopted father.

01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:35.625
And the King.

01:15:43.958 --> 01:15:45.541
For my loyalty and service,

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.833
I was promoted
to the Elite Guard of the Royal Family.

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:55.291
The appointment
was engineered by my father.

01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:59.500
I couldn't have known
it was something more.

01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:03.958
I was given the honor

01:16:05.666 --> 01:16:08.250
of being the bodyguard to Princess Issa.

01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:22.125
The princess was named after
an ancient Queen Issa,

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.750
the Lifegiver.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.083
In the old stories of the queen,

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.041
it was said
that she had the power to give life.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.916
It seemed a myth or a metaphor

01:16:36.916 --> 01:16:41.166
created in response
to the generations of war and conquest.

01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:48.291
Yet, the story still captured
the imagination of the people.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:55.375
And it was believed that the princess,
my princess, might have that same power.

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:04.833
I saw on more than one occasion
things that I... couldn't explain.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:13.375
Things that made me think
that she was different.

01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:17.333
Special.

01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:54.291
The King once said to me...

01:17:56.708 --> 01:17:58.125
When she becomes queen,

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:02.458
I believe she'll bring
a compassion that I've lost

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:07.000
after all these hard years of war.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:10.416
"It will be the dawn
of something better."

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.416
- I think your friendship makes her safer.
- That our friendship made her safer.

01:18:16.916 --> 01:18:18.541
I believed in her.

01:18:19.875 --> 01:18:21.250
In her kindness.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.666
I believed in her ability to save us.

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:19.791
The great General Titus.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500
Thank you.

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.083
Okay.

01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:29.625
Oof.

01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:34.916
Are you sure this is a good idea?

01:19:35.625 --> 01:19:37.583
Let's clean him up and get him sober.

01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:39.958
- Yeah, that'll do it.
-  Come on.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.041
-  Come on.
-  You got him.

01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:44.625
-  Come on.
- Get off me!

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:03.291
What do you think you're doing?

01:20:04.083 --> 01:20:06.208
That's enough. Thank you.

01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:19.458
Did you command
the Eastern ranks for the Old King?

01:20:21.291 --> 01:20:24.541
Are you not General Titus? A legend.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:27.541
I don't know
what you're running your mouth about.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.416
Why can't you just leave me alone?

01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:39.375
Because my best hope is that
long-ago general is still in front of me.

01:20:44.416 --> 01:20:45.875
What do you want from me?

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:48.458
My men are dead because of my surrender.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.875
I'm tired of reliving
that nightmare every day.

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:56.958
Now, please, leave me
and let me die in peace.

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.250
I don't think you're meant to die here...

01:21:06.583 --> 01:21:07.416
General.

01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:08.583
Stop calling me that.

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:10.500
I have no rank, no privilege.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.416
I'm here to make you an offer.

01:21:12.416 --> 01:21:14.250
To give you a chance at redemption.

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:18.208
- I am beyond redemption.
- I have no time for pity!

01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:21.208
What about all the dead men
you once commanded?

01:21:21.208 --> 01:21:22.708
What about them?

01:21:24.583 --> 01:21:26.166
If not redemption,

01:21:27.416 --> 01:21:29.083
what about revenge?

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.541
This is the man
who knows where the insurgents are?

01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:42.375
It is, sir.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.125
Well, I'm listening.

01:22:47.708 --> 01:22:49.750
You'll let me go
if I tell you what I know?

01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:51.666
I'll set you free, you have my word.

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:56.666
I haven't seen
Devra Bloodaxe for a full season,

01:22:56.666 --> 01:23:00.500
but at the time they were on Sharaan,
under the protection of a king called...

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.500
Levitica.

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:07.625
Go on.

01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:10.875
This was some time ago,
but they were definitely there.

01:23:13.083 --> 01:23:15.375
Talk to him, to Levitica.

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:19.208
I certainly will. Thank you.

01:23:31.291 --> 01:23:32.833
Thought we had a deal!

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:33.916
Yes, we did.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.833
You're free.

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:52.791
Dissect his brain and see
if we can find out any more information.

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.708
Then we'll go
pay our respects to King Levitica.

01:23:57.625 --> 01:24:00.041
Yes, Admiral.
I'll set a course for Sharaan.

01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:03.833
Let's go.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.791
Your patience
is appreciated and I can assure you...

01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:38.375
...Devra is aware of your presence.

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:44.875
A decision when to receive you
is imminent.

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:51.041
Thank you, Levitica, honored king.

01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:57.291
We await their arrival.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.208
-  Look.

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:15.791
Farmer, why would you contact us
from this unknown and flagless vessel?

01:26:15.791 --> 01:26:19.958
I was assuming we had a level of trust
after our last meeting.

01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:22.791
We bought your grain to feed our fighters.

01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:27.541
Do not confuse your business of commerce
with our business of revolution.

01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:29.125
I understand.

01:26:29.125 --> 01:26:33.458
Your coming here is a great risk
to us all and to our benefactor.

01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:36.166
But we are no longer
in need of your grain.

01:26:36.166 --> 01:26:39.291
King Levitica's kindness
has been more than enough to sustain us,

01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:42.041
so I suggest you leave immediately.

01:26:42.041 --> 01:26:43.958
We're not here to sell grain.

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:46.083
Gunnar's village
was visited by a Dreadnought

01:26:46.083 --> 01:26:48.208
that threatens its very existence.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:49.875
I have recruited these warriors

01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:52.916
and given my word to bring them back
and defend the farmers.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.291
- But we're running out of time.
- What?

01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:58.625
This handful? Against a Dreadnought?

01:26:58.625 --> 01:27:01.208
That's why we have come.
You have men and ships.

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:03.916
With you we could mount a real defense.

01:27:03.916 --> 01:27:08.958
And, of course, we can pay you
with the surplus from our harvest.

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:11.875
It's all we've got.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:14.125
My forces against the King's Gaze?

01:27:14.125 --> 01:27:15.250
That's suicide.

01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:18.416
That ship cannot be destroyed
by a few dozen fighters.

01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:23.166
That ship and the men aboard it
are world destroyers.

01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:25.583
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:27.833
This man is not a revolutionary.

01:27:27.833 --> 01:27:29.666
He's a simple farmer.

01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.083
But commerce or not,

01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:35.000
his people toiled with their bare hands
to grow the grain that fed you.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:35.916
All of you!

01:27:36.541 --> 01:27:38.541
And because of that transaction,

01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:41.375
their village is now
threatened by Admiral Noble,

01:27:41.375 --> 01:27:44.291
in pursuit of your revolution.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I see.

01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:13.208
I will go.

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:16.250
Thank you.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.666
Brother, a word.

01:28:26.958 --> 01:28:31.791
Our victories, what few there have been,
have been tactical ones.

01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:34.125
We cannot fight in the open
against the King's Gaze.

01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:38.041
If the farmer found us,
it won't be long before Noble does.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:43.791
And I will not allow another world
to fall in our name.

01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:48.583
And what of those you command?

01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:53.083
Their lives are theirs.

01:28:56.291 --> 01:28:57.500
Hmm.

01:29:10.666 --> 01:29:14.250
These people, they've come to us with

01:29:15.041 --> 01:29:16.666
nowhere else to turn.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:18.958
They come...

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:21.000
...seeking our help...

01:29:22.083 --> 01:29:25.500
...to stand against
a Dreadnought of the Motherworld.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.125
Is that not what we stand for?

01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:34.708
Are they not who we once were?

01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:42.708
If we will not stand with these
defiant farmers to protect their home,

01:29:43.291 --> 01:29:45.750
then the revolution is meaningless.

01:29:47.791 --> 01:29:48.875
Under free will,

01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:52.916
who among you
is willing to die for what we believe

01:29:53.916 --> 01:29:55.708
rather than hide behind it?

01:30:12.125 --> 01:30:13.208
Milius.

01:30:14.541 --> 01:30:15.833
Why am I not surprised?

01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:20.541
Who is going to make sure
you'll return in one piece, if not me?

01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:43.375
Thank Levitica and leave this planet.

01:30:48.125 --> 01:30:50.625
Sister, until we meet again.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.375
Maybe this isn't suicide after all.

01:31:27.166 --> 01:31:28.833
Why would he agree to help you?

01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:33.041
Bloodaxe? You think they shouldn't?

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:37.166
It just seems short-sighted.

01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:41.125
I mean, he weakens what little of

01:31:41.125 --> 01:31:43.583
whatever word
you wanna use for it there is...

01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:46.333
Resistance, insurgency.

01:31:47.291 --> 01:31:48.416
For what, Kora?

01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:52.708
The chance to get obliterated
by a Dreadnought?

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:55.583
Guilt, it's a powerful thing.

01:31:56.291 --> 01:31:59.416
Aye, guilt. The underbelly of honor.

01:32:00.708 --> 01:32:02.500
I think I might've had that once.

01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:04.791
Honor.

01:32:05.708 --> 01:32:06.958
Would you believe that?

01:32:08.875 --> 01:32:09.875
It's true.

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:13.416
I mean, what do you figure?

01:32:14.458 --> 01:32:19.916
I got ten, fifteen more seasons at most,
before I steal from the wrong man.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:24.875
Get stabbed to death by some
dog-headed son of a bitch in a bar fight.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.375
It's really your fault, anyway.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.708
Makin' me wanna be an honorable man.

01:32:33.625 --> 01:32:35.791
If you had more
resisting power to speak of,

01:32:35.791 --> 01:32:38.041
you wouldn't need me to join you so badly.

01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:41.416
You're willing to fight with us?

01:32:42.375 --> 01:32:43.541
Since you're beggin'.

01:32:44.791 --> 01:32:47.166
Kai, we're not.

01:32:47.791 --> 01:32:49.291
Well, since you're asking, then.

01:32:49.958 --> 01:32:51.208
If you'll allow me.

01:32:51.916 --> 01:32:52.916
Wow.

01:32:56.333 --> 01:32:57.791
There is one complication.

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:00.041
The shite in the cargo hold.

01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:02.541
I got buyers waiting in Gondival.

01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:05.458
Aren't the kinds known for their patience.

01:33:05.458 --> 01:33:07.833
Might be wise
to sever my ties to life as a thief

01:33:07.833 --> 01:33:10.416
before we go
picking a fight with a Dreadnought.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.166
Besides, you said yourself you need me.

01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:18.375
- I did not say that.
- I think you did.

01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:20.791
I'll set the course
and let 'em know we're on our way.

01:33:20.791 --> 01:33:23.291
Oh, shit, does that make me
one of the good guys?

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.875
I beg you...

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.083
Please!

01:33:36.541 --> 01:33:38.041
I've told you the truth.

01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:41.458
I have nothing more.

01:33:43.541 --> 01:33:44.583
Right.

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:45.958
The truth...

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:50.166
...that you took them in,
known enemies of the Motherworld,

01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:53.958
mended their wounds,
repaired their broken ships,

01:33:53.958 --> 01:33:57.291
all out of your
moral code of honor and charity.

01:33:57.291 --> 01:34:02.666
Our civilization has lived
and thrived for 10,000 years

01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:07.750
with honor and charity
as its most valued tenets.

01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:10.541
Yes. Yes, honor and charity.

01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:14.208
Do you see that?

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:19.416
That ship is named the King's Gaze.

01:34:20.208 --> 01:34:22.208
It was named to honor our slain father.

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.166
So...

01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:29.416
honor I understand.

01:34:32.916 --> 01:34:34.208
Charity, I do not.

01:34:35.375 --> 01:34:38.375
Our King showed charity
to an off-worlder like yourself

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:40.333
and was slaughtered for his charity.

01:34:41.041 --> 01:34:45.750
So, we named the ship to remind us
of the power in that benevolent gaze

01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:48.250
that was lost to charity.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:54.250
And to remember that, if by God's will,
that gaze should fall upon us and be held,

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:57.458
for even the briefest of moments,

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:00.958
it could change your life forever.

01:35:03.041 --> 01:35:04.541
Today, it falls upon you.

01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:22.166
We are cleared to engage.

01:35:22.166 --> 01:35:24.041
- Confirmed.

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:25.625
Fire at will.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.750
Sir, we received a message
from one of our Hawkshaws.

01:35:35.458 --> 01:35:37.583
They're closing in on the Bloodaxes.

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:39.708
Ah.

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.541
Finally, some good news.

01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:45.291
Well, prepare the hyperlaunch.

01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:48.500
I'll go ahead and personally retrieve
the treasonous dogs myself.

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.708
And what orders for the King's Gaze, sir?

01:35:58.291 --> 01:36:00.333
Well, once you've razed the planet,

01:36:00.333 --> 01:36:04.291
we'll rendezvous, extract the exact
location of the rest of the insurgents,

01:36:04.875 --> 01:36:06.833
and destroy them once and for all.

01:36:06.833 --> 01:36:07.750
Yes, sir.

01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:02.125
I'm pretty sure
Kai said these boxes.

01:37:02.791 --> 01:37:04.500
-  We've got one.
-  Okay.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.000
Aye, just take the gray ones.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.416
- They're all marked.
- All right.

01:37:07.416 --> 01:37:11.083
For God's sake, don't look inside.
I'd hate you to think less of me.

01:37:15.791 --> 01:37:16.625
Ho!

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:20.500
Where do you want them?

01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:22.875
- There's space behind the bridge.
- Done.

01:37:24.833 --> 01:37:26.833
All right, put them
the other side of the bridge.

01:37:29.875 --> 01:37:32.500
Aye, let's unload
and get off this godforsaken rock.

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:34.958
I'll be happy to leave this life behind.

01:37:35.625 --> 01:37:36.541
Good.

01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:47.000
Just wanna make sure
that one's on the manifest.

01:37:58.666 --> 01:37:59.666
Pilots!

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:03.708
Once you tie off those ships,
see if you can get some fuel.

01:38:07.125 --> 01:38:10.791
And you two, keep eyes from above!

01:38:32.791 --> 01:38:33.916
How we lookin'?

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:35.833
Everything is done.

01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:39.875
-  All right, let's move.
-  Yes.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.666
- On your mark.

01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:45.666
This isn't right.

01:39:39.625 --> 01:39:40.791
On your knees.

01:39:45.666 --> 01:39:47.625
Now is not the time to be a hero.

01:39:58.291 --> 01:39:59.375
When?

01:40:00.625 --> 01:40:04.416
On Veldt, in Providence,
the first time I heard your story.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:09.500
Thought with your ideals of resistance
I could round up a couple of heads.

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.333
Tarak for instance.

01:40:12.083 --> 01:40:13.916
His world enslaved.

01:40:15.166 --> 01:40:16.541
Then there was Nemesis.

01:40:17.666 --> 01:40:19.291
Her whole family slaughtered.

01:40:20.666 --> 01:40:22.250
But General Titus?

01:40:23.291 --> 01:40:26.708
Have you any idea
how much he alone is worth?

01:40:27.916 --> 01:40:29.500
They would've all jumped at the chance

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.916
to exact any small vengeance
against the Realm.

01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:35.875
Even if the payment
was only a sack of grain.

01:40:39.041 --> 01:40:42.291
Then there was you. Kora.

01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:46.125
Or should I call you Arthelais?

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.583
The biggest prize of them all.

01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:54.291
Do you know what
the Motherworld did to my planet?

01:40:54.875 --> 01:40:57.000
They didn't just destroy it.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:02.166
They tortured every man, woman, and child.

01:41:04.041 --> 01:41:08.500
Left them clingin' to life
as they turned them to ash from low orbit.

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:11.791
You know what that taught me?

01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:16.458
Never set foot
on the wrong side of history.

01:41:16.458 --> 01:41:18.500
Is that what you think we're doing?

01:41:19.625 --> 01:41:20.583
No.

01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:24.125
You've chosen the side that
doesn't even make it to the history books.

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:26.750
What happened to honor?

01:41:27.375 --> 01:41:29.000
What did happen to it?

01:41:30.291 --> 01:41:31.666
Piece of shit.

01:41:39.666 --> 01:41:41.250
Well, who all have we got here?

01:41:44.083 --> 01:41:45.000
Who indeed?

01:41:46.791 --> 01:41:47.791
Commander Bloodaxe.

01:41:49.208 --> 01:41:50.583
Leader of the very insurgency

01:41:50.583 --> 01:41:54.000
the King's Gaze was sent to
this backwater of the galaxy to capture.

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.833
He alone will secure
my seat in the Senate.

01:41:58.333 --> 01:42:02.458
I would be remiss if I failed to mention
we are in the presence of royalty.

01:42:03.541 --> 01:42:05.250
Tarak Decimus.

01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:08.125
Or should I say Prince Tarak?

01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:10.208
General Titus.

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.708
Needs no introduction, does he?

01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:15.958
His actions
at the Battle of Sarawu precede him.

01:42:17.875 --> 01:42:19.000
The farmer.

01:42:21.541 --> 01:42:22.875
The ambitious farmer.

01:42:23.958 --> 01:42:26.333
I pride myself on never being surprised.

01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:28.375
And yet, here I am.

01:42:29.833 --> 01:42:33.458
I understand
why all of them are here... but you.

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:39.250
What could you have possibly hoped to gain
by mounting such a... feeble stand?

01:42:40.291 --> 01:42:41.125
Tell me.

01:42:45.166 --> 01:42:46.416
Oh, yes.

01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:57.541
The legendary swordswoman
known only by the name of Nemesis.

01:42:58.916 --> 01:43:02.208
Assassinated 16 high-ranking
Imperial officers

01:43:02.208 --> 01:43:04.000
and their security details.

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:08.916
All in a hunt
to avenge her slaughtered children.

01:43:09.833 --> 01:43:10.750
Oh...

01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:32.708
Of course.

01:43:36.708 --> 01:43:38.791
Now I thought I recognized
something in you,

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:40.791
down in that filthy village.

01:43:41.458 --> 01:43:43.333
Out there,
amongst all those simple people,

01:43:45.208 --> 01:43:48.000
the most wanted fugitive
in the known universe.

01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:53.458
Scargiver. Arthelais.

01:43:54.083 --> 01:43:57.333
Do you know what you've
done for me, Arthelais, truly?

01:43:58.583 --> 01:44:00.250
Assembling yourself as such?

01:44:01.916 --> 01:44:04.166
When I lay your bodies
at the foot of the Regent,

01:44:04.833 --> 01:44:06.708
I'll be a hero of the Realm.

01:44:07.291 --> 01:44:09.291
They'll write songs
of my feats of courage.

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.291
It's not like I didn't do all the work.

01:44:13.708 --> 01:44:15.416
Let's move this along, shall we?

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:19.250
Let's transport them paralyzed,
in case anyone's feeling frisky.

01:44:20.541 --> 01:44:22.875
On your feet. I've got a job for you.

01:44:25.541 --> 01:44:27.750
Look...
Okay, okay.

01:44:41.916 --> 01:44:45.250
You play your cards right, you at least
might make it out of this alive.

01:44:45.250 --> 01:44:46.625
You're sick.

01:44:46.625 --> 01:44:48.041
And you're a coward.

01:44:53.416 --> 01:44:55.583
All you have to do
is pull the trigger.

01:44:57.833 --> 01:44:58.875
I won't do it.

01:44:58.875 --> 01:45:00.208
Yes, you will.

01:45:02.916 --> 01:45:05.916
You can do it. Just pull the trigger.

01:45:15.333 --> 01:45:18.166
- I know you're in love with her.

01:45:18.875 --> 01:45:19.916
Kora.

01:45:19.916 --> 01:45:22.250
Gunnar.

01:45:26.916 --> 01:45:28.125
I'm so sorry.

01:45:28.125 --> 01:45:29.291
You can do it.

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:39.083
Pilots! To your ships!

01:47:15.333 --> 01:47:16.916
Cut me loose! We gotta go!

01:49:17.458 --> 01:49:19.625
No!

01:53:46.916 --> 01:53:48.166
This is perfect.

01:54:46.375 --> 01:54:47.958
They gave their lives for us.

01:54:52.416 --> 01:54:53.875
They believed in their cause.

01:54:56.416 --> 01:54:58.208
What better thing to die for?

01:55:01.541 --> 01:55:03.333
And I should have died with them.

01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:09.583
I know a thing or two about

01:55:09.583 --> 01:55:14.000
the guilt of carrying on when those
you've sworn to fight with are gone.

01:55:15.416 --> 01:55:16.416
Honor them.

01:55:17.958 --> 01:55:20.041
With everything that you can from now.

01:55:22.375 --> 01:55:23.333
Carry them.

01:55:50.291 --> 01:55:54.291
This was a blow to the Motherworld,
what we did this day.

01:55:55.916 --> 01:56:00.291
Criminals, nobodies,
standing against a machine of war.

01:56:01.708 --> 01:56:05.875
This small act of defiance
gives voice to the voiceless.

01:56:06.666 --> 01:56:11.083
This is more than just a fallen
prick officer and some of his men.

01:56:11.791 --> 01:56:13.791
It's the beginning of something.

01:56:15.291 --> 01:56:16.458
What will they do now?

01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:20.000
The crews of the Imperium
are not known for their bravery.

01:56:21.125 --> 01:56:24.583
After the death of an admiral,
protocol will demand the ship's return.

01:56:24.583 --> 01:56:25.666
That's good.

01:56:26.666 --> 01:56:28.458
We still get paid, I presume?

01:56:29.291 --> 01:56:30.666
A deal is a deal.

01:56:32.208 --> 01:56:33.875
Payment awaits us on Veldt.

01:56:37.416 --> 01:56:40.750
I owe you thanks, Gunnar.
You know, I never did trust that pilot.

01:56:41.583 --> 01:56:42.875
We all owe him thanks.

01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:45.833
He saved us.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.125
I've been wondering.

01:57:43.875 --> 01:57:46.291
Is what that dead bounty hunter said true?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.916
That you're Arthelais?

01:57:50.041 --> 01:57:53.208
Kai was a liar and a thief
who nearly sold you all for a profit.

01:57:54.708 --> 01:57:56.500
Anything more you want, General?

01:57:58.125 --> 01:57:59.250
Don't call me General.

01:58:00.625 --> 01:58:02.291
Hey, you see it?

01:58:03.666 --> 01:58:04.666
There.

01:58:08.375 --> 01:58:09.416
That's our village.

01:58:11.208 --> 01:58:12.083
Home.

01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:13.416
Home.

01:58:14.375 --> 01:58:16.333
I never had a place to put to the word.

01:58:19.041 --> 01:58:21.875
It's almost a shame
you killed that son-of-a-bitch Noble

01:58:21.875 --> 01:58:23.333
and we don't have to fight.

01:58:25.833 --> 01:58:28.083
This would've been
a beautiful place to die.

01:58:36.958 --> 01:58:37.958
Yes, it would.

01:58:43.666 --> 01:58:44.666
Let's go.

01:59:54.125 --> 01:59:56.208
Ready him for transmission.

01:59:56.208 --> 01:59:58.416
Balisarius is standing by.

01:59:59.833 --> 02:00:02.333
Sir,
should we stabilize him first?

02:00:02.833 --> 02:00:06.083
No,
we will not keep the Regent waiting.

02:00:14.708 --> 02:00:15.708
Neurolink.

02:00:18.958 --> 02:00:21.291
-  Link is established.

02:00:37.291 --> 02:00:39.041
Connection complete.

02:00:39.875 --> 02:00:41.125
Signal is strong.

02:01:05.875 --> 02:01:06.916
Send him.

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:40.625
Master.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.125
Balisarius.

02:01:44.083 --> 02:01:45.541
I have found her.

02:01:46.791 --> 02:01:48.541
I have found Arthelais.

02:01:49.291 --> 02:01:50.625
The Scargiver.

02:01:52.208 --> 02:01:54.625
- You're certain it's her?
- I am, my Lord.

02:01:55.208 --> 02:01:58.541
She was in the company of the disgraced
General Titus and Darrian Bloodaxe.

02:01:59.291 --> 02:02:01.083
We are close to capturing them.

02:02:01.083 --> 02:02:06.333
Tell me, Commander. Did you think
that this would be good news?

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.958
That my daughter, Arthelais,

02:02:09.541 --> 02:02:12.041
one of the most dangerous
and decorated warriors

02:02:12.041 --> 02:02:17.750
in the history of armed conflict,
is now part of a blossoming insurgency?

02:02:19.083 --> 02:02:20.583
I'm supposed to be happy

02:02:20.583 --> 02:02:25.958
that she's joined forces with the genius
battlefield commander, General Titus?

02:02:28.416 --> 02:02:30.041
Sir, she is within our grasp.

02:02:32.125 --> 02:02:33.541
Let me bring you her head.

02:02:40.291 --> 02:02:43.750
In truth, I fear the head
most endangered here is yours.

02:02:45.541 --> 02:02:49.500
You will crush this insurgency
to the last man, do you hear me?

02:02:50.875 --> 02:02:53.375
And then you will capture
my daughter alive

02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:56.833
and bring back my precious child to me.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.208
So that I may crucify her
in the shadow of the Senate.

02:03:03.791 --> 02:03:05.541
If you cannot bring her to me,

02:03:07.083 --> 02:03:09.125
then the one whose public execution

02:03:09.125 --> 02:03:12.250
will send shivers
down the spines of the senators,

02:03:12.916 --> 02:03:17.083
and whose screams
will echo down its marbled halls

02:03:18.375 --> 02:03:19.541
will be yours.

02:03:42.583 --> 02:03:44.083
Did he make it back?

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:46.000
I don't know.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.166
I have no heartbeat or brain function.

02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:50.375
Hit him with everything.
